It's rusty, thus it's old? Hah! Rust in Fedora.

It took a while, but thanks to [Josh Stone Rust (the language) is
approaching (as in: landing in)
Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/RustCompiler).

A long time ago a bug was opened to get Rust included into Fedora, but
it was not easy to get in. Rust was (is?) bundling a few libraries. And
some of the required libraries were not packaged. You can read the whole
long story [here, in 79
comments](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915043).

The final reason which gave the necessary push was probably, that
Firefox will soon require Rust for some of it's functionality.

To me it's a great thing to see Rust in Fedora. It's a little thing
which helps to keep diversity.

As always: Provide feedback to improve packaging and the language
itself. I'm also curious to see the first native Rust app in Fedora.
Maybe rusty [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils)?
