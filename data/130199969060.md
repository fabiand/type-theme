SHIFT5 - Decent hardware and: "Warning: Smartphones can be timekillers."
========================================================================

After sending in my [Alcatel One Touch Fire E with Firefox
OS](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/130051494330/alcatel-one-touch-fire-e-firefox-os)
for repair, I tried to grab a nice phone for the meantime - or beyond
...

I've settled with the affordable [SHIFT5](http://shiftphones.com/)
desigend by a small company in Hesse. The producers started with
crowdfunding the SHIFT7 - a phablet - but also produce a 5 inch
smartphone - which I'm now holding in my hands.

It is advertised with:

-   Best effort to produce it "fair"
-   You don't void your warranty by rooting

In addition to this, I am personally very happy that

-   The feeling of the hardware is "solid"
-   The Android is quite clean
-   UMTS, EDGE, ...
-   Dual-Sim
-   

Let's see how the next few months will be.

Btw. This is the kind of hardware I'd like to see Firefox OS on.
