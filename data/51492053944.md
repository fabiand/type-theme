==========================

I'm by no way an expert, but until now
[ORBX.js](http://www.otoy.com/130501_OTOY_release_FINAL.pdf) is - to me
- not much more than a tech demo and not "[the
future](https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/today-i-saw-the-future/)".\
\
ORBX seems to be a propietary video codec, which operates highly
parallel - that there is ORBX.js - a javascript decoder for this codec -
doesn't help the fact that it's proprietary. So I wonder what the
[fuzz](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/05/04/2020235/orbxjs-1080p-drm-free-video-and-cloud-gaming-entirely-in-javascript)
is all about. As said: To me ORBX.js is currently not much more than a
tech demo to illustrate JavaScript's (or more it's interpreters)
capabilities. And currently I couldn't find any hint that ORBX - the
codec - is going to be opened - which is also not as easy, as this would
involve some sort of patent audit to sort out it's patent status.\
\
At last I at least like the fact that it's now shown that there can be
highly parallel video codecs, which can utilize the GPU from a high
level language.\
I wonder if this can be done with [Dirac](http://diracvideo.org/).
