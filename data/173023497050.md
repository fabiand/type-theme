Running minikube v0.26.0 with CRIO and KVM nesting enabled by default
=====================================================================

Probably not worth a post, as it's mentioned in [the
readme](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/alternative_runtimes.md#using-cri-o),
but CRIO was recently updated in [minikube
v0.26.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.26.0)
which now makes it work like a charm.

When updating to 0.26 make sure to update the `minikube` binary, but
also the `docker-machine-driver-kvm2` binary.

Like in the past it is possible to switch to CRIO using

    $ minikube start --container-runtime=cri-o
    Starting local Kubernetes v1.10.0 cluster...
    Starting VM...
    Getting VM IP address...
    Moving files into cluster...
    Setting up certs...
    Connecting to cluster...
    Setting up kubeconfig...
    Starting cluster components...
    Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
    Loading cached images from config file.
    $

However, my favorit launch line is:

    minikube start --container-runtime=cri-o --network-plugin=cni --bootstrapper=kubeadm --vm-driver=kvm2

Which will use CRIO as the container runtime, CNI for networking,
kubeadm for bringing up kube inside a KVM VM.
