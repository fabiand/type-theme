We had the opportunity to present KubeVirt at the regular [OpenShift
Commons
Briefing](https://blog.openshift.com/category/openshift-commons/). Even
if KubeVirt does not yet run on OpenShift, we are still aiming for it -
and Adam actually made [good progress in the past
week](http://adam.younglogic.com/2017/08/deploying-kubevirt-on-origin-master/).

This session also [included](https://youtu.be/IfuL2rYhMKY?t=2570) the
new [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) [based
demo](https://github.com/kubevirt/demo).
