FrOSCon, St. Augustin, 2013
===========================

It's the first time that I'm attending [FrOSCon](http://www.froscon.org)
- a nice and small conference in St. Augustin, near Bonn in Germany.

Fedora booth with Felix and Aleksandra - right beside our friends from
CentOS.

In the front - and a closeup right below - you can see the RepRap which
Miro used to create the nice Fedora key fobs.

On Sunday - right now - there is also a Fedora devroom, with some Fedora
related talks. Sadly I missed Felix "The Cat Is Alive And Running Out Of
The Box".

PHP still seems to be very popular - at least it has a very prominent
presence at the conference. In general a nice small conference.

I also gave a talk about Igor - a tool to test a distribution, the
corresponding slides can be found
[here](http://fedorapeople.org/~fabiand/slides/2013-08-froscon-igor.pdf).
