It was last week when a couple of issues summed up and forced me to
think about how to update my working machine from Fedora 16 to Fedora
18.\
Basically I had the choice between running a fresh (after a decent
backup)Â  install or upgrading from Fedora 16, via 17, to 18.\
In general I really prefer doing fresh installs - as you get a clean
system and old cruft is removed, but this time I tried to avoid to
backup all the little pieces which somehow tangent my work environment.\
Those pieces ain't mission critical, it's just that re-creating them is
boring.\
Long story short - I just went the upgrade path, with doing a fresh
install being my fallback solution.\

I ran pre-upgrade on the Fedora 16, which initially failed (It got
confused by the EFI setup), but this could be fixed by manually adding
the grub entry for booting up pre-upgrade.\
It took a couple of hours until the upgrade was finished. But everything
seemed to work. After trying a couple of applications, I installed fedup
and - just waited. It felt a bit longer but also finally succeeded.\
I was a bit concerned right after the update, because I was confronted
with a dracut rescue shell. But a reboot helped.\
It seems that there is a time out for lucks prompt, which drops you to
the emergency shell in case you don't enter the password in time.\

Now, two days later, everything is still working. Only the kerberos
client UI is missing and I had to install realmd.\
The thing about this is, that I actually didn't expect this upgrade path
to work. I expected more hassles.
