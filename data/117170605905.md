Yes, that has been already done by
[Dan](https://rhatdan.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/running-systemd-within-a-docker-container/),
but I wanted a more stable approach, so basically changing as few stuff
as necessary.

The corner points are now:

-   Add `--cap-add=CAP_SYS_ADMIN` (tho I am using `=ALL`)
-   Add `â€“v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro` (or use a privileged
    container)

That's it so far.
