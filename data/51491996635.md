To get presence into Fedora a so called "review" is needed - as you
might know. If not it's a must [to
do](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_Review_Process) one.\
So if you needed something entertaining tonight, just grab a nice bottle
of Beck's beer (or Bionade Holunder) and a box of Pringles (or Rosinen)
and enjoy the few spec file lines.\
