Fixed: Suspend and Resume on Lenovo x121e
=========================================

Lately - after using suspend and resume extensively - I've quickly
noticed, that the wireless card doesn't come back to live after resume.
After filing a [bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=742513)
and getting help - it was somewhat dump not to update my bios after
right away - I got the bug fixed using
[this](http://support.lenovo.com/en_SE/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS019252)
BIOS/EFI update from Lenovo.\
While burning the ISO onto a CD-ROM I found
[this](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662840) bug: When
nautilus removes the CD drive from the system and doesn't eject the
CD-ROM when pressing the "eject" button in nautilus' sidebar.\
A last word regarding suspend and resume - I am not completely convinced
that the wireless always returns from suspend ...
