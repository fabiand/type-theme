I always wondered but never really looked up how backing files can be
used with qemu. I came back to this when stumbling acrossÂ  the
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
[backend](https://gitorious.org/qemu/qemu/blobs/history/master/block/curl.c)
which brings http and ftp support to qemu and landed in fedora
[recently](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=737006).\
The idea is basically to use some master image accessed via http, e.g.
residing in some
[object](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/openstack-swift)
[store](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/hail), as a
backing file for the actual image. This is a quite flexible setup. No
need for iscsi or so.\
Oh yes, the thing about a backing file is that all reads are happening
on the backing file, until a block is written (also know as *cow* \[copy
on write\]).\
\
It turned out that the magic is happening while creating an image, not
when running it:\
\
`$ qemu-img create -f qed -o backing_file=http://..../amaster.iso instance.qed 20G`\
`$ sudo qemu-kvm -hda instance.qed`\
\
Sadly we can't test this on stock Fedora, as curl is enabled but
currently broken in qemu. Maybe this ain't a bug at all or the bug is
already fixed upstream (there are some fresh changes to curl), so this
can be tested at some near point in the future.\
It is also to note, that backing files also integrates well with
[libvirt](http://libvirt.org/formatstorage.html#StorageVolBacking).\
