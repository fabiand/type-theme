It's so normal that you sometimes don't speak about it - but ...

If you like to track your time in a fine granular way, consider to use
project-hamster with the [GNOME Shell
extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/425/project-hamster-extension/).

On fedora run:

    pkcon install hamster-time-tracker

Then visit the [hamster extension
page](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/425/project-hamster-extension/)
and install the hamster plugin. The rest is pretty self explanatory.
