Drop down terminal for GNOME and taskwarrior
============================================

There are a couple of terminals out there which slide down from the top
of the screen.

But [this one was amazingly easy to
install](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/442/drop-down-terminal/)
and performs ver well on my Fedora 19 machine. It's a GNOME Shell
extension so will - obviously - not work with any other DE than GNOME.

My usecase is mainly to have quick access to a shell and it's very nice
to have this in conjunction with
[taskwarrior](http://www.taskwarrior.org) (yum install -y task) which is
a quite nice alternative to the GUI based todo lists.

Amazing is the tab-completion on tags and arguments.
