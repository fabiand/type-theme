What a week.

To get oVirt Node 3.6 on track we need to rework the basics of Node.
We'll keep much of the grown knowledge (What is needed to configure CIM,
SNMP, KDUMP?), but make them easier to reuse. At first, to allow a
smooth migration to other packages once the knowledge is upstreamed.

In the last week Douglas paved the way to reuse the existing logic, by
[moving all of the logic into a ovirt-node
subpackage](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1191419). This
was crucial, because installing ovirt-node will wreck a normal system.

Based on that work Ryan create a [dbus wrapper around our configuration
classes](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1191962), which
export the relevant functions via dbus. With all the known introspection
magic.

Two big steps for oVirt Node 3.6, paving the [move to
Cockpit](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1190758).

One of the next steps will be to get Cockpit to consume this DBus API.

What a week.
