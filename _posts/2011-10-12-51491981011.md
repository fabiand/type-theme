Hinterher - Tracing vala (c-) code with systemtap.
==================================================

As many others I've read Richard's
[post](http://rwmj.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/using-systemtap-to-trace-into-libraries/)
on tracing shared library calls using
[SystemTap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemTap) (stap). This
reminded me about a problem with vala a while back, which was about how
to profile vala code.\
Taking the following snippet, we will trace the calls to of methods of
the *Foo* class, for some profiling.\

    $ cat  foo.vala
    using Gee;

    class Foo : Object
    {
      public void do ()
      {
        print ("done");
        }
    }


    void main()
    {
      var map = new HashMap ();
      map["one"] = 1;
      map["two"] = 2;
      map["forty"] = 40;
      print ("%d\n", map["forty"] + map["two"]);

      var f = new Foo ();
      f.do ();
      f.do ();
    }
    EOF
    $ vala --pkg libgee-1.0 --debug --save-temps foo.vala

Have a look at the C-code derived from the vala snippet above and look
at the function names, to build a regular expression for the
to-be-watched function calls. It is important to compile the snippet
using the *--debug* switch, this enables stap to look out for the
functions in question.\
Additionally we need the following stap snippet (normally found in
*.stp* files), to add the appropriate hooks to the kernel. The following
stap script get's compiled into a kernel module and watches the mathod
calls on instances of the *Foo* class.

    $ cat  foo.stp
    #!/usr/bin/stap

    global last;

    function display_time () {
      now = gettimeofday_us ();
      delta = 0;
      if (last > 0)
        delta = now - last;
      last = now;

      printf ("%d (+%d):", now, delta);
    }

    probe begin {
      last = 0;
      printf ("ready\n");
    }

    # Modify to match the C signatures of teh methods in question
    probe process("/home/fabiand/tmp/sl")
                .function("foo_[a-z]*") ? {
      display_time();
      printf ("\t%s %s\n", probefunc(), $$parms);
    }
    EOF

Now we've got the binary to trace and the script to watch the
appropriate function calls, next is to compile/launch the script before
we finally launch our binary.

    $ sudo stap -tv foo.stp
    ready

And on a different terminal run the binary:

    $ ./sl
    42

This should get the above stap call, to spit out the following (or
comparable) lines:

    1318412226924288 (+0): foo_new 
    1318412226924298 (+10): foo_get_type 
    1318412226924309 (+11): foo_construct object_type=0x11afe30
    1318412226924317 (+8): foo_class_init klass=0x11aff30
    1318412226924324 (+7): foo_instance_init self=0x11a7180
    1318412226924330 (+6): foo_do self=0x11a7180
    1318412226924348 (+18): foo_do self=0x11a7180

First there is an absolute timestamp, followed by the delta between two
(matched) function calls in brackets. The delta does not mean that the
function call took so long, it is more the time between two function
calls matching the regexp in the *.stp* file, so there can be an
arbitary number of function calls between two listed ones.
