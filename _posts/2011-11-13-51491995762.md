yum update fails in Fedora 16 because of broken certificates
============================================================

Today (and also the last days) I ran into trouble when updating my
system.\
yum update ran silently in to the error:\

    $ sudo yum update -y
    Geladene Plugins: auto-update-debuginfo, langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit
    Fehler: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository:
    fedora. Please verify its path and try again

That didn't tell me a lot about the error, also a yum clean metadata
didn't help.\
After a bit of googling I stumbled across the URLGRABBER\_DEBUG variable
which tells yum to debug all URL fetching stuff, this lead me to the
error:\

    $ sudo URLGRABBER_DEBUG=1 yum update -y
    Geladene Plugins: auto-update-debuginfo, langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit
    ...
    Could not get metalink https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?
    repo=fedora-debug-16&arch=x86_64 error was
    14: Peer cert cannot be verified or peer cert invalid
    Fehler: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository: 
    fedora. Please verify its path and try again

It was discovered last year that such errors are [not passed to the
user,](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=576267) but it might
be a good idea to fix this.\
To get around the error you can temporarily disable the verification of
hosts using yum's setopt switch:\

    $ sudo yum update --setopt=sslverify=false
