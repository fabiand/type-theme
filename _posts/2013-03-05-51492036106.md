A package for rust - Mozilla\'s experimental language
=====================================================

\
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) has picked up a language to address a
couple of common issues in coding. The language they picked is
[rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).\
It doesn't fit into my current environment, but it has some nice
features, like lightweight threads (green threads) and message passing
support which make it interesting for me to play with. These are two
features which I am missing in [vala](http://www.vala-project.org/) -
but they might just be a bit out of scope of vala's focus.\
\
I've only played with rust a little, but to ease Fedora users access to
this language I've created an initial
[specfile](https://github.com/fabiand/rust-spec/blob/master/rust.spec)
which can be used to build the package.\
~~For convenience I'm also providing an rpm.~~\
\
Rust is currently not suitable for an official inclusion into Fedora's
repositories as it builds it's own [patched version of
llvm](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4259), does some stuff with
[rpaths](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5219), .... There is
work to upstream the patches, but that's still far in the future.\
\
So - [pick it up](https://github.com/fabiand/rust-spec) and install it,
look at the quite nice
[tutorial](http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html) and get your
hands dirty.\
\

    # Clone
    git clone git://github.com/fabiand/rust-spec.git

    # Build requirements
    sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ python perl curl fedora-packager

    # Build it
    cd rust-spec
    rpmbuild -ba rust.spec

\
Edit: It is assumed that your [env is set up for building
packages](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package)
