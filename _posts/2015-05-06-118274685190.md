1:1 mapping of host side NICs into a container
==============================================

You might want - i.e for testing purpose - map all your host sided NICs
into your container.

There are several ways to do this, one way is to use macvlans.

This small script
[map-nics.sh](https://github.com/fabiand/dockerfiles/blob/master/map-nics.sh)
can be used to map all host sided NIcs matching a glob expression into a
given container.

This simply works by creating a [macvlan
device](http://www.pocketnix.org/posts/Linux%20Networking:%20MAC%20VLANs%20and%20Virtual%20Ethernets)
on the host side and then move it into the network namespace of the
container.
