udev events in containers
=========================

You can monitor events related to udev by using:

    $ udevadm monitor

And for fun you can trigger events by calling:

    $ udevadm trigger --subsystem=net --action=change

udev has actually two types of events - thanks prajnoha - kernel events
and udev events.

The kernels events come from - well - the kernel and have minimal
informations. The udev events come from the udev daemon, after
processing the udev rules and have many more informations (those created
and attached by the rules). To monitor just the one or the other you can
use:

    $ udevadm monitor --kernel --env
    $ udevadm monitor --udev --env

Sometimes you might want that a container get's those events from the
host as well. I.e. to monitor the creation of new blockdevices, think of
a containerized udisks which wants to follow dynamic system changes.

Without a hassle a container can see the kernel events. But currently I
do not see a way to retrieve the host side generated udev events inside
the container.
