POC of how simple a rootfs image can be pulled into ram and be used for
booting. A candidate for oVirt Node stateless mode.

In this example
[iPXE](http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/fabiand_boo_build_testing/) is used
to boot an image, containing the latest vdsm, cockpit and glusterfs
bits, directly off [Jenkins](http://www.jenkins.ovirt.org). The image
being pulled is [build on a
nightly](http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/fabiand_ovirt-node-tng_image_build_daily_testing/)
basis and - the best thing - [sanity
tested](http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/fabiand_ovirt-node-tng_image_install_testing/).

The intention of the image to make it the platform for testing the
Next-Gen Node bits.

Currently the vdsm contained in this image is not working properly (at
least the last time I tested), because the image is based on Fedora 21,
and vdsm has issues with that Fedora version. The plan is - and that is
already prepared - to base the imae on CentOS 7 (CentOS seems to be
quite popular among oVirt users). But that is currently blocked by a
[bug](http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=8239), which prevents building
our images.
