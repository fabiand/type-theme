Once in a while we are setting up our workstations - yet again.\
I often faced the problem to migrate my finest selection of packages
from my former system, to the new one.\
Groups are surely one way to install roughly those packages you need on
the new system, but in very rare cases your package selection is
unique.\
\
The following snippet might help you, to install the packages of
`DA_OLD_HOST` on your new system.\
On your new host:\

    $ ssh $DA_OLD_HOST 'rpm -qa --qf "%{NAME}\n"' \
      | xargs yum install -y --skip-broken

\
Hint: It seems as if something is broken with the fedora mirros, you can
work around problems by commenting the mirrorlist and uncommenting the
baseurl option in the appropriate yum repo .conf.
