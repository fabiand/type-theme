oVirt Node Next's delivery format is a squashfs (or squashfs wrapped in
an rpm), the benefit is that itcan be used by dracut (possibly stateless
boot) and anaconda (can install the image).

Now, with a few commands it is possible to even generate a custom
installation ISO for oVirt Node Next.

This works by fetching a CentOS 7 boot.iso, our squashfs image, and
rebuilding a new iso from these two contents (plus a small kickstart as
teh glue).

Run this command to generate an ISO containing the latest Ndoe Next
build from our Jenkins CI:

    $ curl "https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node-ng.git;a=blob_plain;f=scripts/create-nightly-boot-iso.sh" | bash

> Notice: This is only for the brave - Never run unreviewed scripts from
> the web.

Once Node Next is installed you can just run `yum update` on a daily
basis to retrieve updates.
