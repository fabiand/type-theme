I'm working on a small library/daemo/client which wrap some
functionallity ofÂ  vgaswitcheroo, a small kernel feature to handle
hybrid graphic setups found in some laptops.\
\
The main intention is to allow the user to switch to the required card\
Sometimes this switch is required, because just one of the cards is
connected to the external output of the laptop - which can be used to
connect a beamer.\
\
The current code can be found at
<https://gitorious.org/valastuff/gswitcheroo>.\
daemon and client should be working by now, but the installation bits
need some work.\
\
My intention is to add some configuration point to gnome-control-center.
A first suggestion was to use the "System information" -\>
Graphics-Tab.\
Any suggestions and early adopters?
