Sometimes a small HTTP server which can be used with\

    $ curl -T dafile dahost.local

is handy. You can use it to upload small logfiles etc without any
authentication, so something like tftp.\
\
Python's own SimpleHTTPServer is a simple webserver, but it only
supports GET and HEAD requests.\
By simply deriving from that class you can create a small server
supporting PUT.\
