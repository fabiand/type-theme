If you have ever dreamed of using augeas from vala, your dreams have
been [heard](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/vapis/trees/master/vapis) -

The binding is nearly complete, just aug\_span is missing. So dive into
xml using augeas, [even](https://fedorahosted.org/augeas/ticket/238) in
relative paths.
