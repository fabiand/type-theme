weston -Brdp-backend.so \-- Wayland\'s RDP backend
==================================================

kalev mentioned that wayland's RDP backend is already part of Fedora's
wayland builds. I just gave it a quick shot:

(VM with weston running - to the right, remmina as an RDP client -- to
the left)

This basically means that wayland is acting as an RDP server (without
session management).

    $ pkcon install xkeyboard-config weston

This installs wayland (and a dependency). To then start weston with the
RDP backend use:

    $ weston -Brdp-backend.so

Finally you can use remmina to connect to wayland.
