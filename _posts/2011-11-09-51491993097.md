Because of the recent stirs regarding
[OpenCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) in our FLOSS ecosystem
(think about
[clover](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Esteckdenis/clover/),
[pocl](https://launchpad.net/pocl),
[libclc](http://www.pcc.me.uk/%7Epeter/libclc/) and there is one I am
missing ...) and some demand on my side, I tried to use OpenCL (in form
of [Intel's OCL
SDK](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-sdk/) - as clover
and pocl require some bleeding edge clang/llvm) from Vala - my favorite
language in the ecological niche of GNOME.\
\
My first attempt was a straight binding of the *cl.h* without modeling
the intended OO structures. Modeling the intended structure is possible,
but there are more things to do, like run-time checks (ever heard of
ErrorCode?) ..\
Yesterday I ended in writing a small set of wrapper classes in
[vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) (so effectively a GLib wrapper around
the low-level OpenCL C API), calling the native C functions via the
created low-level API.\
Today I got first [basic kernel
running](http://gitorious.org/valastuff/vapis/blobs/master/tests/opencl/simple.vala),
that's nice progress (I just tested in on a CPU, GPUto go ...)\
This wrapper removes a lot of the boilerplate (and checks) needed to get
OpenCL and a kernel running.\
\
There is still much room for improvement in the wrapper, much can be
cleaned up and
[VAPI](http://gitorious.org/valastuff/vapis/blobs/master/tests/opencl/gopencl.vala)
can be restructured to incorporate the OO structure of OpenCL.\
This could lead to a simpler wrapper.\
\
Well, it's start - like the projects mentioned in the first paragraph
...\
Dig into it at
[gitorious](http://gitorious.org/valastuff/vapis/trees/master/tests/opencl).\
