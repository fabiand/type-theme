Session wide logging in GNOME.
==============================

\
Currently each application in GNOME is using GLib's logging
functionality or something custom.\
Errors written to stdout get logged in *\~/.xsession-errors* - and other
places we don't know about.\
\
What I would like, is to have a central place for application related
logging. This could have many benefits:\

-   Users have a single place to look out for errors applications didn't
    (yet) tell them about.
-   A logging daemon can keep a history and this could help solving
    bugs, e.g. it could be added to *abrt* reports.
-   Leads to less clutter in \~/.xsession-errors

If such a daemon is introduced, it should to be easy to integrate and be
backwards compatible. In my eyes talking to this daemon can easily be
realized by providing a *GLogFunc*, which handles the appropriate
communication with the daemon. Additional features - like searching or
exporting - could also be provided by the DBus interface, bt this is not
important for logging itself.\
\
And this is what I suggest:\
\
**slogd** a simple logging daemon, providing a DBus interface to log
messages.Â  This daemon also has an example backend which logs the
messages into a sqlite database (via GDA).\
\
**libslogc** a very tiny library to communicate with the daemon and
**slogc**, a small tool wrapping libslogc. libslogc also provides
*slog\_client\_log (...)*, a GLogFunc to be used from C.\
\
And there is finally *simple.c*, a small example on how to integrate
libslogc. (Well, there ain't much to do.)\
\
The code can be found at <https://gitorious.org/valastuff/slog>.\
This is a prototype to get some feedback and see what other people think
about a central logging daemon.
