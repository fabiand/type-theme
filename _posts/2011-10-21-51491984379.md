**Intended purpose**: Use this application to transmitt audio and video
in an n-to-m-peers fashion in quite high quality and with a hopefully
low latency. This can be the case in scenarios like connecting video
walls, e-lecture or simple bi-directional two people communication.\
\
**Intended audience and requirements:** This application is designed for
an elite circle of users who are in a situation with:\

-   no NAT problems, e.g. IPv6 users
-   one multicast domain or access to their DNS records
-   quite high bandwidth, like 2 Mb/s
-   secured transport way, aka VPN or or non-public network
-   multi-core systems (single core Intel Atoms are a no-go), but
    something like an AMD E-350
-   Fedora 16

\
**Design:** Trageting a very specific need (near-realtime bi-directional
a/v transmission in a *good quality*, not caring about bandwidth and
security) this tool also doesn't follow public standars like RFCs, but
more builds ontop of available features (e.g. gstreamers *rtpgstpay*).
On the other side standards are use:\

-   RTSP stream control
-   dirac video codec
-   vorbis audio codec
-   mdns service discovery
-   Mx based interface
-   Fulscreen mode
-   IPv6 support

Currently presence is some kind of beta. Find out more on the
appropriate [page](http://dummdida.blogspot.com/p/presence.html).
