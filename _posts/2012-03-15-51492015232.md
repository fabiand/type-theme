Package management using zif.
=============================

As yum was introduced I was happy about it's features. Also some of the
later features like history and the rollback are nice and handy.\
But yum can be slow.\
\
If you want to use a different rpm high-level management system with a
comparable featureset to yum give zif a try:\

    $ sudo yum install -y zif-tools PackageKit-zif

This also installs the zif backend for PackageKit - which appears to the
user as the package update dialog.\
Many known commands will work:

    $ zif search yum
    $ sudo zif install -y livecd-tools
    $ zif # will print help
