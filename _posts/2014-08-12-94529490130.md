Gerrit\'s REST API
==================

Gerrit has a nice [REST
API](http://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api.html).

I had the need to quickly check if a change was merged or not, it turned
out to be quite easy:

    while read CHANGE ; do curl "gerrit.ovirt.org/changes/ovirt-node~master~$CHANGE" ; done

That way I just had to paste the change-id into the terminal and quickly
got my response.
