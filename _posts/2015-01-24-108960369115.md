The approach of the [html5 spice
viewer](http://www.spice-space.org/page/Html5) is to run an *emscripted*
spice client in the browser. This has the benefit that many spice
features (i.e. audio) are available as well. But it seems that this
feature will miss 3.6 - but this is a very nice feature, so what can be
done ...

A much more simpler, but more restricted, approach is to make the guest
output more suitable for the browser. For example, encode graphics and
audio in a browser capable format i.e. webm. Input can be pipped back to
the guest using some websocket protocol.

It seems that gstreamer can not directly transcode RFB (vnc) to WebM,
but at least to mjpeg:

    $ qemu-kvm -vnc :0 &
    $ { \
      # Send teh HTTP header
      echo -e "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=--boundary\r\n\r\n" ;  \
      # And the seperated images
      gst-launch -q rfbsrc view-only=true incremental=false ! decodebin ! colorspace ! queue ! jpegenc quality=50 ! multipartmux boundary="--boundary" ! fdsink ; \
    } | nc -l 4593

This stream can be viewed with this simple HTML:

    <html>
    <body>
    <img src="http://127.0.0.1:4593">
    </body>
    </html>

Quite simple, and the result can be seen at the top of this post.

Some tear drop: gstreamer's RFB client does not (yet) support to signal
size changes correctly, and the stream will end.

But: If you use the `rfbsrc` with `autovideosink`, you can at least use
it as a simple client, with input support!
