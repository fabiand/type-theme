Mesa\'s OpenCL state tracker on Fedora is around the corner
===========================================================

Thanks Igor. (Not the oVirt Node related one).
[ignatenkobrain](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ignatenkobrain)
form Fedora's mesa fame.

He invested some time and prepared a build with the correct build
switches to build mesa-10 with OpenCL support. After a bit of fiddling
(installing necessary deps \[libclc-devel\]) the result was this:

This is amazing. The first run of clinfo on Fedora with Mesas OpenCL
implementation.

-   Upstream - fix mesa.icd to contain absolute path to .so
-   Add correct mesa-libOpenCL dependencies on libclc-devel, mesa-libgbm
-   Discuss necessary global mesa changes
-   Koji builds

Spec changes are on
