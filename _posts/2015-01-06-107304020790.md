[Previously](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/98799178310/testing-multipath-with-qemu)
I mentioned that multipath can be tested with plain qemu. Today I want
to mention that it's also possible to test ,ultipath with virt-manager,
or [libvirt](http://www.libvirt.org) in general.

The basic trick is to point two (virtual) storage devices to the same
backing image. And both devices must use the same serial. Caching should
also be disabled.

Summarized:

-   Multiple storage devices
-   Same backing image for all of them
-   Same serial for all of them
-   No caching for all of them

> Note: You need a raw (not qcow2) backing image, otherwise you can run
> into this [bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178941)
