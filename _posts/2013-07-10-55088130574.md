title: "Installing Fedora using iPXE and BFO (boot.fedoraproject.org) via the world wide web"

I just got round to boot Fedora right out of the world wide web using
nice service <http://boot.fedoraproject.org>.

What's that service? Well, you basically point gpxe (which is the PXE
loader which is used e.g. by libvirt and friends) to the image offered
by BFO, gpxe downloads it and you are dropped into a grub menu where you
can install any recent Fedora release.

All you need to do is, drop into the iPXE prompt using Ctrl+B and enter
the following lines:

    dhcp net0
    imgfetch http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/bfo/bfo.lkrn
    imgload bfo.lkrn
    boot bfo.lkrn

The rest is done by iPXE and the initial small image. Very handy when
your local setup is currently not up to date.

Hint: Append `text` to initiate a text or minimal install (select the
grub entry, hit TAB to edit the entry, append `text` and boot).

Note: You can use this method to install Fedora in a oVirt Engine
environment if you don't have the most recent Fedora ISO in your ISO
Domain.
