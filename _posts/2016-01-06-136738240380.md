Bash's errexit and subshells
============================

Python's try-except-finally construct is pretty nice and I was looking
for something similar in bash. I imagined something like:

    ( # Try
      set -e
      run_a_cmd
    ) || { # Except
      echo "ERROR"
    }
    # Finally
    cleanup

The assumption is that the "Try"-block will fail if any command inside
the block fails, because`set -e` is used to set `errexit`. But this does
not work. Why it is not working was not directly obvious to me. The
reason is now - and you can look this up in the bash manpage - that
`set -e` or `errexit` is ignored if a subshell (`(…)`) is used with `||`
or `&&` - and this is the case above.

The following construct is working:

    ( # Try
      set -e
      run_a_cmd
    )
    test $? -gt 0 && { # Except
      echo "ERROR"
    }
    # Finally
    cleanup

This does work because `||` got eliminated.

This construct is a bit less nice, but still helpful.
