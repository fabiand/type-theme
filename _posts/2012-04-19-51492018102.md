Wow. After such a long time it happened. Gstreamer can be used as a
[multimedia backend in
Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=422540)!\
\
So what does this mean? I believe not much yet for the enduser, at least
this is a very nice infrastructure change to enable stuff like hardware
acceleration e.g. on mobile devices. And from my point of view also a
good separation: Do one thing and do it well. Let gstream do the
multimedia stuff and Mozilla all that compositing.\
\
Maybe this can be enabled in Fedora - at compile time - to get an maybe
accelerated experience. or better codec support e.g. h264 for those who
need it (e.g. by using Fluendos codec pack) or even my always favored
[Dirac](http://diracvideo.org/)!
