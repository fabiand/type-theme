kdump? On the host.
===================

`kdump` is one of those technologies which are a bit tricky in the
container world. Well, what does tricky mean, it wsa tricky to mean how
all the involved components interact. After all it turns out to be
simple: kdump is on the host (atomic) and can be triggered by privileged
containers. That's it.
