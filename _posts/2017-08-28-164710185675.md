Fancy things are a driving factor.

Thus recently GitHub drove me to add gpg signatures to (first) tags and
now to commits in general.

The reasons is that those tags and commits stick out by getting a
verified tag. You [can see](https://github.com/kubevirt/demo/pull/14)
the small greenish box with "Verified" on the right hand side:

You need a couple of things to get there:

1.  Make sure to install `dnf install gnupg2` on Fedora.

2.  [A GPG
    key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/)

3.  [Associating your email with the
    key](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-an-email-with-your-gpg-key/)

4.  [Uploaded GPG key in
    GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

5.  [Configure (gpg-agent) and git to sign your
    commits](https://help.github.com/articles/telling-git-about-your-gpg-key/)

All of this is nicely documented at GitHub - kudos for this
documentation.

Once the basics are setup, you can use this for signing
[commits](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/)
and [tags](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-tags-using-gpg/).

For tags I went a little step further and looked into
[git-evtag](https://github.com/cgwalters/git-evtag) which is using a
stronger hash and also recursing over submodules. The primary reason for
this was to allow using the git tree as a primary artefact for code
delivery. Which is appropriate sometimes, but not always.

And with all of this, you also get the fancy verified labels on release,
as [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases):
