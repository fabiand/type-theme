Ain't unicode chars nice? :)\

Finally, after much work EFI (much thanks to the anaconda team and all
those testers) support is quite mature in Fedora 16 Beta. There are
still some issues (➫ bugzilla) but in general it's working.\
\
**Hardware**: It's not easy to see if your hardware supports EFI
booting, best is took in your BIOS and see if the magic EFI keyword
appears somewhere.\
\
**Boot media**: If you want to try out an EFI boot media you've got two
or three common ways of doing so.\

1.  First you try the Fedora 16 Beta DVD or netinst images.\
    You can write those images to a DVD using nautilus (right click on
    the iso ...).\
    **Note**: If you want to use them via a USB-stick you need to use
    the *livecd-iso-to-disk* tool, part of the  livecd-tools package.
    Also remember to pass the *--efi* switch. In generall it should look
    somewhat like the following example:
2.  The other way is to use the *efidisk.img* which can be found in the
    images directory of the DVD images. This image can be written to a
    USB-stick using dd:

        $ sudo dd if=efidisk.img of=/dev/sdg

\
Also note that the LiveCD images are ~~*not yet*~~

bootable on a native EFI system.  Normally those systems will fall back
to a legacy BIOS boot, which also makes it hard to determine if a system
is booted via EFI or BIOS. (The path `/sys/firmware/efi` exists on
systems booted via EFI)\
\
EFI plus some [boot](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd)
[optimizations](http://www.harald-hoyer.de/personal/blog/fedora-15-8-services-you-can-most-likely-disable)
can then finally lead to quick boot process.
