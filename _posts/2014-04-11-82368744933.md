Automatically testing VMs using pexpect and qemu
================================================

[Igor](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/tagged/igor) does his job, testing
[Node](http://www.ovirt.org/Node) images on virtual machines and real
hardware. But one drawback is that it's "big". It is not huge, but it is
not directly usable out of the box.

Out of the blue - while playing with [some
ideas](https://github.com/fabiand/imgbased/) - I coupled
[pexpect](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect) (now updated to 3.1 in
Fedora) with qemu (and a stdio serial).

What I got is a simple mechanism to control a VM. With much less
assumptions then Igor has.

The drawback is obviously that only VMs can be tested, but the benefit
is that it is very simple, and there no high requirements. And this is
also limited to the console - which is optimal for Node.

Long story short, the snippet below takes an image, boot's it and tries
to login via the serial console.

This can further be extended by using 9pfs to exchange data between the
host and guest.

A [minimal functional
test](https://github.com/fabiand/imgbased/blob/master/tests/functional/sanity.py)
is now also in imgbased to test some basic functionality at runtime.

This doesn't seem to be a new
[idea](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-install/2006/08/29/0000.html).
