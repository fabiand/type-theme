Tonight I had a bit of time and got
[gswitcheroo](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/gswitcheroo) in a usable
state.\
gswitcherd is launched by systemd and gswitcher is launched
gnome-session-manager. All fine.\
\
If gswitcherd detects a connected HDMI port on boot it tries to turn on
the discrete card (effectively turning off the integrated). Sadly there
is currently a [bug](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41002)
(or so) in vgaswitcheroo which prevents the successful switching from
one to another card between plymouth and gdm. Maybe this will be fixed
at some point - or not be needed at all ...\
\
Another problem is about looking up the HDMI status (to automagically
detect what card to use). This is just possible if the discrete card is
powered on, but this ain't the case when we are using the integrated
card. The current solution is to power on the discrete card once and
again, to determine the HDMI status.\
\
Beside all problems gswitcher will notify you about a freshly connected
monitor and will ask you to log out (and back in).\
