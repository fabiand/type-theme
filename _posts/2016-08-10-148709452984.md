oVirt Node 4.0
==============

oVirt Node, the slim OS acting as a hypervisor for oVirt deployments
showed it's age already a few years ago. It was time to take some
action, to not drown in endless bugs which were contradicting how
operating systems are [put together
today](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/).

We started researching around the end of 2014. Main goals were to
leverage more open source projects - basically anti-NIH. The benefits
are obvious: Why write our own installer if there is one? Why create an
admin interface if there are a few?

[We looked at](http://www.ovirt.org/develop/projects/node/specs/)
deploying oVirt in containers back then, and also at delivering it as an
ostree - both had drawbacks which we could not work around at that time.

Anyhow, after a long decision period, a couple of POCs, more bug fixes
on vintage Node we are finally here: [oVirt Node
4.0](http://www.ovirt.org/node/).

Features, in chronological order

-   Ready to use with oVirt Engine
-   Self Hosted Engine support
-   CentOS 7 as a base
-   Anaconda for installation
-   squashfs and rpm as a delivery format
-   Cockpit for administration
-   imgbased for LVM management
-   rpm for update delivery
-   Writable root file-system

Start now to install oVirt Node 4.0 using an
[iso](http://plain.resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-4.0/iso/ovirt-node-ng-installer/).
Updates can be done through Engine or even with `yum`.
