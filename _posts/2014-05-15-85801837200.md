title: "From GDM into a virtual machine"

To extend the battery life of my netbook I started to move much of my
tooling to remote servers.

One thing I lately tried was how I could directly log into a remote
virtual machine, after the GDM login. One way is to create a specific
GDM session:

    $ cat /usr/share/xsessions/f20-builder.desktop 
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=F20 Builder
    Exec=mutter & virt-viewer -f -c qemu://node.local/system f20-builder
    Icon=
    Type=Application

Exchanging ssh-key up-front makes the experience even more relaxed.
