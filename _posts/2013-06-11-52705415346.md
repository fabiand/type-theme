Finding files which changed between git revisions
=================================================

We've - oVirt Node - now got a [jenkins
job](http://jenkins.ovirt.org/view/ovirt_node/job/ovirt-node-devel-check/)
which does some [basic static
checks](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node.git;a=blob;f=src/Makefile.check;hb=HEAD)
on our python code.

Checking the few tens of files takes roughly minute. But in a hassle to
save even more energy, we want the checks to be only performed on the
changed files. And not the whole source tree.

The following git command will list all the files (relative to the git
tree root) which changed between the two revisions (HEAD\~1 and HEAD, so
during the last commit):

>     $ git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD
