NICs are needed inside containers. By default docker is adding a single
linkl to a container. Somtimes tho, you want more links inside the
container. There are several ways to do this:

-   Use veths and bridges
-   Use
    [macvlans](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/118274685190/1-1-mapping-of-host-side-nics-into-a-container)
-   Use `--net=host`
-   Move individual NICs into the containers network namespace

There are likely more ways to do this, but the ones above are the ones I
looked at up to now.

Considering that `--net=host` put's alll host sided NICs into the
container, you might wonder why I investigated the other methods. The
reason is that `--net=host` breaks the isolation between the host and
container badly, and also has an effect on the network connectivity of
other containers on the network.

So I'm looking for a less desruptive way to have more NICs inside the
container. `veths` and `macvlans` have the **advantage** that they are
virtual, and can be added and handled easily, and provide a clean
separation between the physical NICs and the NICs inside the container.
The **drawbacks** are potential performance issues, also the
functionality (`ethtool` ...) *is* limited. `ethtool` will only see a
virtual NIC, and can not configure stuff like offloading - because that
is only available on the physical NIC. It is also questionable if fancy
network layouts inside the container (bonds, bridges, ...) will work as
expected.

`--het=host` and moving individual NICs into the containers network
namespace has the **advantage** that the container can operate on the
real NICs. I'd expect less performance and functional issues as we
operate on the real physical NIC. The **drawback** however is that with
`--net=host` we break the hosts connectivity and interfere with other
containers. The drawback of moving individual NICs is, that it's
sometimes not easy to decide in an automated way, what NICs to move into
a container. I.e. think of the `LABEL install â€¦` convention to install
containers using the `atomic` command, which would move the NICs between
namespaces, would need to decide which NICs to move.

We see there are - as often - many ways to achieve something, but it
needs to eb carefully considered what approach suits the individual
usecase.
