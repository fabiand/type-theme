There is currently working going on on bringing [CI testing to oVirt
Node](http://ovirt.org/wiki/Node_Testing) - our smallish Fedora based
"hypervisor".\
Enabling automated testing is quite a challenge, because
[Node](http://ovirt.org/wiki/Node) is not using anaconda/kickstart for
installation, works with a read-only rootfs and uses a snack/newt based
TUI. Many existing automated testing solutions have problems with some
these aspects - because they rely on kickstart or on ATK.\
\
Anyhow, the
[testcases](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node-tests.git;a=tree;f=tcs;hb=HEAD)
which are run on Node are typically written in bash or python. There are
a couple of common functions that are needed in both languages (e.g. to
communicate with the testing server or providing a common logging
function).\
It's quite error prone to have functions in both languages providing the
same functionality, and that was the point where I looked for a method
to automatically or "natively" call python functions from bash (not
[calling bash from python](https://github.com/amoffat/pbs/)).\
Searching didn't lead to any good alternative, therefor I've come up
with the [this bash
snippet](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node-tests.git;a=blob;f=libs/common/common.sh;hb=HEAD)
which creates bash functions for all callables of a given python
module.\
This might not be perfet, but it does the job in our case.\
\
The TUI testing - while we are at it - is now done using uinput.
