title: "fn main() // Rusts entry point - and an update to 0.8"
author: fabiand

[Rust 0.8 was released](http://www.rust-lang.org/) two some days ago.
The [spec](https://github.com/fabiand/rust-spec) is already updated and
a build was triggered in
[Copr](http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/detail/fabiand/rust/builds/).
Sadly Copr currently fails to build rust on all arches. But I've got
faith that there will be a complete build ready within the next days.
Besides that there are builds for some arches which can be used.

Anyhow, besides 0.8 being ready I've also [played with rustpkg - a
high-level tool for rustc and
friends](https://github.com/fabiand/example.rs).

If you follow the intended filesystem layout you get benchmarks and
tests for free - well, you'll still have to write them, but they -
benchmark and tests - are part of the regular build.

And that is what the example.rs layout is about. To practice what
rustpkg excepts.

And never ever underestimate decent tests. Start with them right from
the beginning - and you'll have an easier life :) That's actually a nice
habbit Ive seen in software around all those popular languages in
popular niches (aka mobile or nodejs) .. That quite some really take
care about writing tests.
