[oVirt Node Next](http://www.ovirt.org/Node/4.0) is like a big puzzle.

In the classic - or *vintage* - oVirt Node a lot of the build logic,
administration, and customizataion tooling was custom built. This was
ideal back then when Node was born more than eight years ago (the
repository goes back to Nov 19 2007), because a lot of the stuff Node
used was just not there.

A few of the nifty things of the past include

-   Blacklisting recipes to minimize the ISO
-   `edit-node` to customize the ISO
-   The TUI setup to ease administration
-   The TUI installer to install Node
-   ...

All of these things were maintained by the core Node team - with
occasional contributions from other contributors. This worked well while
Node was small. But when Node gained more features, and all available
features were used the number of bugs started to rise. In the end a lot
of time was spend on just maintaining the current code-base, without
room for real steps forward.

Now, eight years after classic Node we are in a situation that existing
technology is more advanced and new projects appeared on the dance
floor.

In this environment of more advanced technologies and diverse projects
we noticed that a lot of the functionality Node provides, is already
there. Taking the examples from above ...

-   [Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org) is working itself to provide
    a smaller footprint, a side effect of the whole Cloud image movement
    and lately also because of [Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io)
-   The [guestfish](http://libguestfs.org/) family is around to help you
    to modify existing images
-   [Cockpit](http://cockpit-project.org/) is there to ease host
    administration
-   And [anaconda](https://github.com/fabiand/anaconda) matured well to
    provide a nice installation experience

All the functionality we maintained ourselfs for years is now available
in other projects. Once we saw the common denominator between all those
technologies, it was clear that the next version of Node should combine
existing technologies efficiently, rather than to continue to develop
and maintain them ourselfs.

And integrating all the different technologies and projects together is
like working on a puzzle. It's more bringing the pieces together to
reveal the final image^[1](#fn:1){.footnote-ref}^.

    Okay, granted, classic Node was also like a puzzle, but a lot of
    glue was needed to create the
    picture. [↩︎](#fnref:1){.footnote-backref}
