Canonical URL for download.fedorproject.org mirror redirection
==============================================================

Lately I wondered my url based kickstart failed to run. It turned out
that the problem was an incorrect url.

    http://download.fedoraproject.org/fedora/linux/releases/$relver/Fedora/$arch/os/

does not redirect you to a close mirror, because ... of the missing
`pub/`.

Using this incorrect URL will just brin up a blank page, sadly no 404 -
Consumers like anaconda are silently hanging in mid-air and can't
continue.

The correct URL is:

    http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/$relver/Fedora/$arch/os/
