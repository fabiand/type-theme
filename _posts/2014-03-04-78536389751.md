Raising the append line char limit by upgrading pxelinux
========================================================

IIUIC the number of chars appended to the kernel during PXE boot is
limited by two things: The kernel itself and the bootloader - pxelinux
in my case.

Ancient kernels had a limit of 256 chars, but this limit was raised and
doesn't exist with 2.6 anymore.

What I did not know was that the pxelinux limitation was also raised.
Now it is possible to pass up to [2048
chars](http://www.syslinux.org/archives/2010-July/015258.html) - I also
read 4096 chars somewhere else. At least many more then previously (1024
or so, at least lower).

So updating [pxelinux](http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/PXELINUX)
to some recent version will allow you to pass more arguments to the
booted kernel. This is especially relevant for
[igor](https://github.com/fabiand/igor/), when testing
[Node](http://www.ovirt.org/Node).
