\
To make testing fun I looked at improving the speed of static syntax
checks.\
The latest incarnation is now using make targets to represent a specific
checks. The nice thing about this is, that you can use Make's `-j`
switch to run those tests in parallel.\
\
So basically it looks like this:\
\

    check-static-pep8: $(PYTHONSOURCES:%=%.pep8)
     @echo Passed $@

    %.pep8:
     PYTHONPATH=. pep8 -r "$*"

\
The complete makefile is
[here](https://gitorious.org/ovirt/igord/blobs/master/Makefile.check)
and the numbers:\
\
Simple:\

    ...
    ---
     Passed check-local
    ---

    real 0m22.875s
    user 0m20.466s
    sys 0m2.158s

\
\
And in parallel:\

    ---
     Passed check-local
    ---

    real 0m11.459s
    user 0m34.780s
    sys 0m3.325s

\
There is so much that can be done.
