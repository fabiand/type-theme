title: "Update on EFI and Fedora 16 Live images."

Somehow Fedora 16 re-gained EFI support - after it was lost in the
beginning of the Fedora 16 process. The trouble seems to be introduced
partly because of the migration to
[grub2](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735023) or changes
to anaconda.\
But as of [Fedora 16 TC1](http://markmail.org/message/3zcvwwphbtbs3dxn)
also the [Live
CDs](http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/stage/16.TC1/Live/x86_64/)
support EFI! Look
[here](http://dummdida.blogspot.com/2011/10/efi-fedora.html) to learn
how to make a bootable USB media from the iso you downloaded.\
\
As we already know, the installation DVDs already support EFI, since rc3
(or so).\
Participate and provide some feedback (e.g. via IRC or
[bugzilla](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/)) on bugs when
[testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Results:Current_Desktop_Test)
out the
[media](http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/stage/16.TC1/Live/x86_64/).
