[Attaching guestfish to live
domains](http://libguestfs.org/guestfs.3.html#attaching-to-running-daemons)
is actually pretty nice. Why? Why is this different from the normal
mode? Well, normally guestfish spawns a generic appliance to inspect a
disk image. The runtime context is thus this appliance. If you connect
to to a running (libvirt) domain, then you run the commands in teh
context of the domain. This can make a difference if you want to i.e.
introspect the runtime behavior of an domain, like getting some network
informations.

It works nicely in Fedora, if you install a VM with

    virt-install â€¦ --channel="unix,target_type=virtio,name=org.libguestfs.channel.0"

Inside the guest you need to ensure to have `libguestfs-live-service`
installed.

But why the heck doesn't this work on CentOS!? Because the
`libguestfs-live-service` is not available there.
