title: "flatpak-ing Servo Nightly"
author: fabiand

[Servo](http://servo.org) - that rendering engine written in
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) - can be built from source. But there are
also nightly builds available.

But the [issue with those nightly
builds](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12015) is that they depend
on \$very old crypto libraries - which might be because the [builder
distro is so old](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/issues/462) - and
those are not shipped on Fedora 25. This effectively makes it annoying
to run these builds on Fedora.

One way to solve this issue is to provide a
[flatpak](http://flatpak.org) for these builds. Flatpaks are containers
(shipping and runtime) and will thus also contain the dependencies -
liek these nagging crypto libs.

However long story short, I've created this small repo which can be used
to wrap the Servo nightly binaries in a flatpak wrapper - and it's also
adding the two annoying dependencies.

Thus - once they get published you can run Servo on your Fedora (or
other flatpak distro) without issues.

Feel free to try it out:

    $ git clone https://github.com/fabiand/flatpak-servo.git
    $ cd flatpak-servo
    $ pkcon install flatpak
    # NOTE flathub seems to be down right now
    $ make
    $ flatpak run org.servo.Servo wikipedia.org
    # OR - for browserhtml
    $ flatpak run org.servo.Servo

You should be greeted with something like

I'm actually not sure why the
[browserhtml](https://github.com/browserhtml/browserhtml) view is so
broken ...

Next step would be building servo from source using `flatpak-builder`.

It was actually pretty nice to work with flatpak.
