yum, dnf - their common frontend: pkcon
=======================================

pkcon - the commandline client for packagekit is actually quite nice.

    # To search for a keyword
    $ pkcon search details opencl

    # To enable updates-testing
    $ pkcon repo-enable updates-testing

    # To install a package
    $ pkcon install -y clpeak

    # To see available commands:
    $ pkcon

What I like about it is, that it is fast. But maybe this is because of
`yum-cron`.

Once PackageKit (and `PackageKit-browser-plugin`) is installed it also
allows fancy things like this (you should see an in-browser field to
install a package locally):
