targetcli on pre-Fedora 21
==========================

[`targetcli`](https://github.com/agrover/targetcli-fb) seemed to be a
nice way to create an iSCSI target - which I needed - on Fedora 21.

I actually followed
[this](http://workaround.cz/cmd-targetcli-iscsi-target-lio-and-fedora-18/)
guide which is quite nice. But there is one difference from `targetcli`
on Fedora 18 and on Fedora 21:

On Fedora 21 the service which restores the LIO configuration is in a
separate package (and called differently). `python-rtslib` - yes very
intuitive - is the package called, which ships `target.service` (on
Fedora 19 it was called `targetd.service`, and part of targetcli). This
service is responsible for restoring the LIO configuration on boot.

Long story short: Use `targetcli` to configure LIO. And use The `target`
service to save and restore this configuration on boot.

    # Install targetcli
    pkcon install targetcli

    # Ensure to enable and start the relevant service
    systemctl enable target.service
    systemctl start target.service

    # Ready to do the configuration
    targetcli

    # IMPORTANT: Save your configuration
    targetctl save

In general a nice tool, I'd be happy to see a nicer documentation. But
to be fair, there might be one which I haven't found yet.
