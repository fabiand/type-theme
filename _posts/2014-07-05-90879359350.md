Mozilla\'s precompiled Rust for Fedora
======================================

It is still not easy to package rust for Fedora in the intended way,
which includes using Fedora's llvm and libuv.

A much easier way which I now chose is to use the official [rust
binaries](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) and wrap them in an
rpm. This can then be build in
[Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/fabiand/rust-binary/).

The `rust-binary` package includes the official release. The same method
can also be used to create a `rust-nightly-binary` which could deliver
the precompiled rust nightlies.

Now it's easy to enjoy rust on Fedora - especially with the lately
discovered [Rust By Example](http://rustbyexample.com/).

To get started you just need to run:

    # We are using dnf's copr plugin, because it is - easy!
    $ pkcon install dnf dnf-plugins-core

    # Enable copr repo
    $ sudo dnf copr enable fabiand/rust-binary

    # Install rust-binary
    $ pkcon refresh
    $ pkcon install rust-binary

    $ rustc --version
    rustc 0.11.0 (aa1163b92de7717eb7c5eba002b4012e0574a7fe 2014-06-27 12:50:16 -0700)

Please note that the rpm only includes `rustc` and `rustdoc`, not
`cargo`, rust's upcoming package manager.
