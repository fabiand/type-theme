Meh - Migrating a VM - in Kubernetes? WTH.

Kubernetes is hosting stateless pods. That's okay. Kubevirt is running
pet VMs on these stateless pods, andyou can read more about it
[here](http://kubevirt.io).

However, whenever you encounter a situation where you end up running a
VM in KubeVirt, then you can now also use VM migration to migrate VMs
from one host to another - using the KubeVirt API:

To level expectations, this is early work. And it surely needs to
mature.
