Doing PXE with libvirt / virt-manager

\
\
Installing hosts using PXE is a well known thing.\
Why not do it within libvirt? Or: How do I do this in libvirt?\
Do I need to setup my own dhcp server to pass the bootp option? Nope.\
Just use libvirts default dnsmasq and add the bootp dhcp option.\
\
All you need to do is editing the default network configuration using
virsh (no way o do it from virt-manager).\
\

    # virsh net-destroy default
    # virsh net-edit
      Now add "<bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='$PXESERVERIP' />" under /network/ip/dhcp
    # virsh net-start default

\
All done.\
Just have a look at the definition
[here](http://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html#elementsAddress) to read
about more features.
