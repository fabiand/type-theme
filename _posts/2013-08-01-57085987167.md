fedup to Fedora 19 and trouble with encrypted volumes
=====================================================

Today I updated my Fedora 18 to Fedora 19 using fedup.

The setup itself went smooth. But the initial boot failed with some
message telling me that /home could be mounted (home resides on an
encrypted volume).

That didn't sound nice ... After a couple of failed un-educated guesses
I found
"[**BugÂ 980587**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=980587) -
[Upgrade from F18 to F19 via FedUp on encrypted system (luks/dm-crypt,
no LVM), can't boot normally".]{#short_desc_nonedit_display}

That looked like my problem. But no. It didn't solve for me.

As it turned out I had to use the new lvm.conf (which resided in
lvm.conf.rpmnew after the update). Renaming it to lvm.conf and running

    dracut --force

Fixed the problem - The volume was picked up by systemd and mounted
correctly.

The system was now upgrade from Fedora 16 on ...
