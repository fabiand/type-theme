Encryption by default, even with no authentication, why? Because it
[defend(s) against Pervasive Monitoring attacks without the need to
sacrifice anonymity.](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7619.txt)

libreswan 3.14, which comes with initial (prototype) support for null
auth, is available in Fedora 22 updates-testing.

Enabling it by default for connections can be achieved as follows:

    # Write the OE (null auth) configuration
    echo > /etc/ipsec.d/oe.conf <<EOC
    # From: https://github.com/libreswan/libreswan/blob/master/testing/baseconfigs/all/etc/ipsec.d/ikev2-oe.conf
    # default policy
    conn packetdefault
            type=tunnel
            left=%defaultroute
            authby=null
            leftid=%null
            rightid=%null
            ikev2=insist
            right=%opportunistic
            failureshunt=passthrough
            negotiationshunt=passthrough
            auto=route
    EOC

    # Enable conf snippets in /etc/ipsec.d
    sed -i "/include.*ipsec[.]d/ s/#include/include/" /etc/ipsec.conf

    # Start ipsec (will generate nssdb if necessary)
    service ipsec start

Now you can check that connections to other hosts (where OE is enabled)
will establish secure connections right away (with no more aotaheadahead
of time key exchanges):

    # Monitor
    tcpdump -i any proto 50
    ipsec status
    â€¦
    000 IPsec SAs: total(1), authenticated(0), anonymous(1)

This works fine for me on my local network, the security however, needs
to be proven.
