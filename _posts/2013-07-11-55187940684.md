For debugging purpose it's quite useful to paste some output to
[fpaste.org](http://www.fpaste.org). With the old fpaste that was a bit
cumbersome. But the new fpaste.org site has a nice API which can be used
in a restless fashion.

To paste a file, just call:

    $ curl \
        --data-urlencode paste_data@/tmp/log \
        -d paste_lang=text \
        -d api_submit=true \
        -d mode=xml \
        fpaste.org

The API documentation can be found
[here](http://www.fpaste.org/doc/api/).
