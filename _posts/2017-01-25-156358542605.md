[Previously](https://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/155910978455/one-way-to-represent-and-handle-virtual-machines)
I've been looking a little into how VMs could be run on a cluster
manager like Kubernetes.

And the previous post was already pretty specific about the design of
such a solution.

[KubeVirt](http://kubevirt.io) is a
[project](https://github.com/kubevirt) implementing this approach. Thus
running virtual machines on top of Kubernetes by using Kubernetes TPRs
and custom controllers and daemons.

We've been actually working on it for a while, and are finally in a
shape were there is a (hopefully) easy to use demo. Just give the
following command a try on your Fedora 25 machine:

    $ curl run.kubevirt.io/demo.sh | bash

This will normally not wreck your host, but instead download a virtual
machine and deploy Kubernetes and KubeVirt in it. Afterwards you can
easily access it to play around.

Feel free to [browse our code](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt),
documentation, and designs at <https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt.> Or
provide fixes to the demo at <https://github.com/kubevirt/demo.>

We will also be giving two talks at

-   DevConf.cz 2017 - Friday, Jan 28, 15:00 - ["WTH - Kubernetes and pet
    VMs? No way."](https://devconf.cz/schedule.html)
-   FOSDEM 2017 - Saturday, Feb 04, 12:30 - ["Pet-VMs and Containers
    united?"](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/iaas_petconuni/)

In addition there is also a small day-long [KubeVirt gathering at
DevConf.cz
2017](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/tree/master/devconf-unconference-2017).
