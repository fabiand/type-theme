Yum feels slow sometimes. That's not new. I was impressed by
[zif](http://dummdida.blogspot.de/2012/03/package-management-using-zif.html)
and how much quicker it is. And now, once again I'm impressed how quick
[dnf](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DNF) is.\
Besides beeing quick - dnf is also looking quite clean.\
So let's see when it get's into a prominent position, for now you can
install it on Fedora 18 by using\

    $ sudo yum install -y dnf

The commandset is not yet as comprehensive as yums, but the basics are
working.
