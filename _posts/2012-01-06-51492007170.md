Spieglein - Sharing public keys via display and webcam (or so)
==============================================================

Sharing (cryptographic) keys is still mandatory in or cryptography
landscape.\
A nice exmaple is our `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file which contains a
list of public ssh keys which are allowed to login.\
One way to exchange those keys is using `ssh-copy-id`.\
\
Another one is using a webcam and some display - like the ones found in
laptops or mobile phones (but even white paper works ;)\
The principle is quite simple, just [QR
encode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) your public key and point
the webcam at the screen to get a picture of the QR encoded public key
and decode it.\
Voila you've got your own copy of the public key. And it's quite hard to
intersect photons on their way from the display to the webcam, so your
copy can be trusted.\
\
It is as easy as encoding the image\

    $ bash create_pubkey_qr.sh 

\
This results in a image like this:\

::: {.separator style="clear: both; text-align: center;"}

\
Now, on the receiving computer, run\

    $ ./look_for_qr.vala

And point the webcam at the surface displaying the QR code in question
...\
\
You might need to install some dependencies using\

    $ sudo yum install -y vala glib2-devel qrencode \
    gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extras

\
\
Just look [here](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/stuff/trees/master/q2r)
for a working example.
