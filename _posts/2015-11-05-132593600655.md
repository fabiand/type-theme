Connecting user-session VMs
===========================

VMs spawned in a libvirtd user-session are not connected by default
because they use SLIRP connectivity (don't ask me about the SLIRP
details). However, this means the network is just within the process and
NATed to the outside world. If oyu now have several VMs in the
user-session, they can not speak to each other, because they are
separate processes, and because each of them is getting NATed, one
doesn't see the other.

To workaround this issue you can use the following snippet to attach an
additional network device to a VM, which is using a UDP multicast group
to distribute it's network traffic. If you use this snippet (with
different MACs) for all VMs in the user session, they all get attahced
to the same multicast group and can thus see each other - if the network
interface within the guest is configured correctly.

The magic:

    <qemu:commandline
     xmlns:qemu="http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0">
      <qemu:arg value='-netdev'/>
      <qemu:arg value='socket,id=busnet0,mcast=230.0.0.1:1234'/>
      <qemu:arg value='-device'/>
      <qemu:arg value='virtio-net-pci,netdev=busnet0,mac={mac}'/>
    </qemu:commandline>

This [bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1278317) is
tracking an RFE to add this functionality to libvirtd.
