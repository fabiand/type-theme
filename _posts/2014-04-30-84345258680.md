My current netbook is a Lenovo x121e. It served me well for the last
years, but it felt like the time has come to retire it.

The main decision points for a new netbook are the CPU (must be AMD),
low power usage, the form factor (14\" or below). All of this is
showing, that I am not looking for a power horse, but a nice a silent
machine for idling, travels and occasional idea drafting.

The current netbook I used was a Lenovo x121e, a AMD E-350 (or 450?)
based netbook. It performed well in the scenarios where I used it.

After a good amount of research - where I found out that there don't
seem to be many netbooks which meet my requirements - I finally settled
with a [Samsung ATIV Book 9
Lite](http://www.samsung.com/de/consumer/notebooks-displays/notebooks-pcs/ativ-book/NP905S3G-K01DE?subsubtype=ativ-book-9).

It has a slightly modified quad-core AMD A-1450 APU (which is Jaguar
based), an 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM. The CPU might be a bit underpowered
with 1GHz and the RAM could also have been a bit larger. But the first
impressions are that the specs are enough to run Fedora 20 with GNOME 3
without (m)any hassles.

Some hints:

-   BIOS: You can reach it by pressing F2 when the Samsung splash
    appears
-   SecureBoot: Initially worked, now doesn't. Needs to be investigated.

The important stuff works out of the box: Wifi, suspend to RAM, and all
the other hardware.

Let's see how it behaves in the daily life.

Pros:

-   Fedora 20 runs fine
-   AMD A-1450 (Jaguar microarchitecture based APU)
-   Low-Power usage
-   Nice case and keyboard
-   Good hardware support (suspend, audio, wifi)
-   Very silent (nearly fanless)

Cons:

-   Power connector is badly designed
-   Built-in battery
-   Suboptimal display

P.s.: In general it seems to compare well to a "Chromebook".
