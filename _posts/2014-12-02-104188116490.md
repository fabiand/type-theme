Ways to persist, a reminder
===========================

I already wrote about persistence, now some diagrams to be more specific
about some of them:

External
--------

                     external

                     +------+
              .......| /etc |.......
              :      +------+      :
              :                    :
    +--------------+           +--------------+
    |              |           |              |
    | layer-1      |           | layer-2      |
    |              |           |              |
    +--------------+           +--------------+

The most easy approach to persist data residing in `/etc`, is to keep
`/etc` on a separate volume is shared between layers. `etc` will be kept
*external* of the layers.

Copy
----

                           copy
                ...........................
                :                         :
                :                         :
            +------+                   +------+
    +-------+ /etc +           +-------+ /etc +
    |       +------+           |       +------+
    |              |           |              |
    | layer-1      |           | layer-2      |
    |              |           |              |
    +--------------+           +--------------+

Another way is to copy the state from `layer-1` to the next layer,
possibly applying some logic to update the configuration files if
necessary.

Merge
-----

                        3-way-merge
                ...........................
            (1) :                         :
                :     ................... : .......
                :     :                  `:Â´      :
                :     : (2)               :       : (3)
            +------+  :                +------+   :
    +-------+ /etc +  :        +-------+ /etc +   :
    |       +------+  :        |       +------+   :
    |              |...        |              |....
    | layer-1      |           | layer-2      |
    |              |           |              |
    +--------------+           +--------------+

3-way merging is actually a specialization of the *copy* method. The
reason is that a way merge can be seen as copying the existing
configurtaion and applying the changes, which were also done to the
changes applied to `layer-1`.

All of the previous approaches were context-free, in the sense that they
could be applied to all configuration as long as it was plaintext.

Individual
----------

                        individual

              ............. a ...............
              : ........... b ............. :
              : : ......... c ........... : :
              : : :                     : : :
            +------+                   +------+
    +-------+ /etc +           +-------+ /etc +
    |       +------+           |       +------+
    |              |           |              |
    | layer-1      |           | layer-2      |
    |              |           |              |
    +--------------+           +--------------+

With individual I am referring to a method, were some service is
deciding how a specific configuration file should be migrated from
`layer-1` to `layer-2`. That service can for sure use the simple *copy*
or *merge* approach, but it could also apply some advanced logic to
evenm migrate binary files.
