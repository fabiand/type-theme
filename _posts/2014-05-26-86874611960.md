Please use Firefox or Chrome to view this video.

The first scenario is basically a dummy because of [this
bug](https://fedorahosted.org/cloud/ticket/60) (missing serial console
output for the bootloader).

The second scenario finishes quickly, before the vncviewer can be
attached.

The vncviewer schon in the cast is actually attached to the third
scenario.

The QEMU\_CMD in the beginning just forces the backend to use qemu-kvm
instead of using qemu with emulation (which is slower).
