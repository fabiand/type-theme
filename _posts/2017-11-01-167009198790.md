Updating to Fedora 26
=====================

![Fedora 26

Finally - after [the presentation at KVM Forum
2017](http://redhat.slides.com/fdeutsch/running-virtual-machines-on-kubernetes-with-libvirt-and-kvm-at-kvm-forum-2017)
- I took the opportunity and updated my primary laptop to Fedora 26.

I used gnome-software for it, and everything went eventless, which is
surprising, as I use luks, EFI, and blue jeans.

The only hassle so far was that blue jeans does still not support screen
sharing when Wayland is used (but this is known), and that my screen was
messed up and frozen after some time with two connected diesplays.

But this is really neglectable - Updates are just lame these days.
Awesome.
