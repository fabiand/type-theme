oVirt Node and Foreman reminder
===============================

netbulae noticed, that the following snippet can be used during an oVirt
Node auto-installation to prevent continous reboots:

    local_boot_trigger=http://foreman.example.com/unattended/built?token=<%= @host.token %>

or

    local_boot_trigger=<%= foreman_url("built") %>

That will tell Node to call this URL after the auto-install, calling
that URL tells Foreman to disable PXE boto for that host.

Reminder: Take care to adjust the FQDN of your foeman instance in that
URL above.
