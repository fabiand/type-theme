libclc - a package review request
=================================

libclc is a build dependency of mesa if you want to [build mesa with
OpenCL](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=887628) support.

I really would like to see OpenCL support on Fedora. I've just submitted
a [package review request for
libclc](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=984312) so we can
meet that requirement (reviewers are welcome!). The goal to have some
decent OpenCL support on Fedora - at least with AMD Radeon hardware
isn't so far away. It will be awesome!

Rust already has an OpenCL binding ... And maybe it's also time to also
look at Vala's OpenCL support ...
