Missing Computing Device Manufaktur
===================================

I'm not really sad, but I wonder: Where are the people and companies
caring about decent computing hardware. I mean shiny, stylish laptops,
solidly build, reliable, durable, and maybe not
[beef](http://www.intel.cmo), but [tofu](http://www.amd.com).

We know that [one](http://www.apple.com) ... who was it ... vendor. But
that can not be everything. [Many](http://www.samsung.com)
[others](http://www.lenovo.com) make devices, but they lack *it* - the
bit which makes a device perfect, different, fitting, the thing you
want.

Can it be that hard?

The mobile world is showing that smalld evices can also be done by small
"*Manufakturen*". [Geekpshone](http://www.geeksphone.com),
[Jolla](http://www.jolla.com), and [Fairphone](http://www.fairphone.com)
are just three examples of small vendors which build decent hardware.
