[oVirt Node 4.0](http://www.ovirt.org/Node/4.0) is a step forward. We'll
be leveraging much more of existing projects (anaconda, cockpit, lvm)
and try to write much less of our own code:

A big advantage of this new architecture is that we can be much easier
consumed. The first fruit is integration testing of oVirt Node and oVirt
Engine:

One pro - already mentioned: It's so easy to integrated both of them.
But the test setup is quite nice - it is [completely runnable with user
privileges, and completely decoupled from the
hardware](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/132940914200/integration-testing-of-node-and-engine).

It's so convenient.

[Try it out
yourself](https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-appliance.git;a=blob_plain;f=tests/README.md;h=dc9f965c711172deaadf43c28e62df28dc6aa59c;hb=HEAD)
(it will take some time, and will download a few packages from the
internet):

    # Install dependencies
    sudo yum install -y \
        libvirt-daemon \
        libvirt-client \
        libvirt-daemon-qemu \
        libvirt-daemon-kvm \
        python-sh \
        virt-install \
        libguestfs \
        libguestfs-tools \
        openssh-clients \
        squashfs-tools \
        python-nose \
        python-pep8 \
        pyflakes \
        libselinux-utils

    # Permissive mode is required for now
    sudo setenforce 0

    # Checkout the repository
    git clone https://gerrit.ovirt.org/p/ovirt-appliance.git
    cd ovirt-appliance
    git submodule update --init
    cd tests

    # The build and testing itself
    make clean-build-and-check

If you can't try it, here is how it looks (skipping the build part):

    $ make check 
    nosetests --with-xunit -v --no-byte-compile
    Create and add a host and wait for it to come up ... ok
    Create a storage domain on Engine ... SKIP: Not implemented
    Use a storage domain and host to spawn a disk-less VM ... SKIP: Not     implemented
    Check that the basic IP connectivity between VMs is given ... ok
    Check if the node can reach the engine ... ok
    Check that the engine comes up and provides it's API ... ok
    Check that a host can be rebooted and comes back ... ok
    Check if host can be shutdown gracefully ... ok
    Check if snapshots are working correct ... ok
    Check if basic SSH is working correct ... ok

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    XML: /home/fabiand/work/ovirt/gerrit/appliance/tests/nosetests.xml
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 10 tests in 1467.470s

    OK (SKIP=2)

Looks dense, right? Doesn't look fancy? Both of this is good: Dense -
perfect, easy to see. Fancy? No need if nothing is broken.
