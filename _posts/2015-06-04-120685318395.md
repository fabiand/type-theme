[oVirt Engine](http://www.ovirt.org) provides the web-based management
interface (webadmin) in oVirt. In addition it communicates with
postgresql to maintain the database of all the involved entities. And it
is based on [JBoss](http://www.jboss.org) and can be installed on
[Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org) or
[CentOS](http://www.centos.org).

This kind of application is perfectly suited for
[containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization)
- well - you've probably heard of them.

Well, as it's suitable I gave it a go - I'm not the first one who gave
it a go, Moran
[also](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/ovirt-dockerized/)
[did](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/ovirt-dockerized-part-2/)
this. My work is similar to his, I just tried to leverage some
enhancements which popped up in the last 6 months - mainly the
integration with the `atomic` command and a simpler integration with
systemd.

The image is based on this
[Dockerfile](https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-container-engine.git;a=blob;f=Dockerfile;h=4fa88b5a59564c84bf39c7ee731600cd66fd2ad8;hb=HEAD)
and [this atomic installation
script](https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-container-engine.git;a=blob;f=container/atomic-install.sh;h=3b1243f5bb13e6ce4e41b8364df1ae5bb819976c;hb=HEAD)
to perform the engine setup on deployment.

With the `atomic` command the usage is quite easy:

    atomic install fabiand/ovirt-engine-3.5
    # or
    ADMINPW=foo atomic install fabiand/ovirt-engine-3.5

With `docker` it's a few more lines:

    export IMAGE=docker.io/fabiand/ovirt-engine-3.5
    export NAME=ovirt-engine-3.5

    # Use a transient (--rm) container to create the real the container
    docker run --rm -v /:/host \
      -e FQDN=$(hostname) \
      -e ADMINPASSWORD=${ADMINPW:-ovirt} \
      -e NAME=$NAME \
      -e IMAGE=$IMAGE \
      $IMAGE container/atomic-install.sh

(Note: You can also use
`docker inspect -f '{{.Config.Labels.INSTALL}}' docker.io/fabiand/ovirt-engine-3.5`
to retrieve the correct commandline directly from the image)

After this run you can access oVirt Engine on port 80 and 443 of that
host.

However, there are still some unclean or open ends:

-   Take care of upgrades
-   Find a nicer way to set the admin password
-   For now [postgres](http://postgresql.org/) is bundled
-   Static vs dynamic ports
-   Use the latest oVirt bits
-   ...
