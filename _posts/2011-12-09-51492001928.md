title: "OpenCL on Fedora: A quick look at building pocl."
author: fabiand

Finally a 3.0 release candidate of llvm is packaged for Fedora and
available via rawhide. Many of the current OpenCL implementations like
pocl and clover depend on llvm-3.0 and with this release it is finally
an easy thing to build pocl on Fedora.\
pocl has some other pre-requirements besides clang/llvm, after
installing them you can just build the software as usual:\
\

    $ sudo yum install --enablerepo=rawhide llvm-devel llvm clang \
    libtool-ltdl

    $ git clone 
    $ bzr branch lp:pocl
    $ bash autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
