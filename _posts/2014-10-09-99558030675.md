Ever wondered if it was possible to test
[~~multipathing~~](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/98799178310/testing-multipath-with-qemu)
PXE boot with qemu? it turns out it is.

Basic idea: Extract an iso using Fedora's `livecd-iso-to-pxeboot` tool
and point qemu to that directory.

    $ livecd-iso-to-pxeboot <isoname>
    $ qemu \
        -hda hda.qcow2 \
        -net user,tftp=tftpboot,bootfile=pxelinux.0 -net nic

Nifty?

It will probably be re-used in some test automation context.
