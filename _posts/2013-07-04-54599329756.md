[Rust 0.7 has been
released](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/release-0.7/RELEASES.txt).
With a couple of changes - two things poked into my eyes: The changes
around memory management and iterators.

Grab the updated package from
[copr.](http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/detail/fabiand/rust/)

Copr doesn't yet support Fedora 19, so don't wonder about missing
packages.
