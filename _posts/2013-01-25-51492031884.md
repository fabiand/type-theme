Nothing new, just GNOME 3
=========================

GNOME 3 is my favorite DE.\
I really appreciate how much works has gone into GNOME. Into the UI and
below the surface. Seen from my perspective GNOME - as on Fedora - turns
into the best system-integrated DE. The control-center can actually be
used to control system stuff - thanks to all the changes that happened
below, within cups, systemd, pulseaudio, colord, ... To me Fedora feels
more like one system, and not several layered components.\
Sure, the changes were disruptive and not every one is happy with the
results - but that's just normal. And I wonder about all this ranting
and bashing on changes.\
In the case of GNOME it's also nice and somewhat refreshing to see that
there is a plan - a vision - of where to go and what to form.
