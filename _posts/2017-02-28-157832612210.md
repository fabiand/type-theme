Containerized iSCSI Demo target
===============================

If you want to boot a VM of a disk, then you obviously need a disk.

And as I'm currently playing with launching VMs of iSCSI target's I took
this as an excercise to come up with a nice setup to easily deploy iSCSI
targets on a Kubernetes cluster to provide demo images for booting VMs.

Initially I went with writing up a [small docker image to add LIO iSCSI
targets](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/94/commits/2b4022b5b1565fa6672761c068fabc9cb1c5e546).
But this solution was not really portable (i.e. not running on
minikube), because it requires Kernel support (LIO is an in-Kernel
target).

But luckily there are some other iSCSI target implementations which
provide user-space iSCSI targets - like `tgtd`. Alpine - which I
initially used - did not offer tgtd, thus I switched over to use Debian,
which provides - at least it feels like it - every single project which
exists since the beginning of unix timestamp 0.

Anyhow, long story short. With tgtd it was easy to create an [image
which contains Alpine and CirrOS as demo images, and export them in a
tgt
target](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/94/commits/121a585457c138fe4336602487a4624b00c4f7da).

The result is now a simple docker image which you can launch, and if you
export the right port, then you got a ready to use iSCSI target which
serves Alpine, CirrOS, and an empty LUN. All of those are inside the
contianer, thus the data is not persisted.

Feel free to try it out:

    $ docker run \
      -p 3260:3260 \
      -it fabiand/iscsi-demo-target-tgtd


    # To test:
    # In another terminal
    $ qemu-system-x86_64 \
      -snapshot \
      -serial stdio \
      -drive file=iscsi://127.0.0.1/iqn.2017-01.io.kubevirt:sn.42/2

    # Or just to discover
    $ iscsiadm --mode discovery -t sendtargets --portal 127.0.0.1
