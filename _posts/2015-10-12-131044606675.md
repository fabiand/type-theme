View your GTK3 app or VM on the Web
===================================

Ever wondered how to view gedit in a browser? It's not a secret anymore,
[broadway](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-broadway.html) is
there for some time. The nice thing is that you can also view VMs (by
launching `virt-viewer` with thebroadway bcakend):

How does it work? On a Fedora 22 Workstation (or any with gtk3) host do:

    broadwayd &
    GDK_BACKEND=broadway BROADWAY_DISPLAY=:0 \
        virt-viewer -c qemu:///system the-domain-to-view

And then browse to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/.> That's it. And nothing
else: Don't expect audio or USB to work.

Take a look at `broadwayd -h` to get an idea baout how to publish this
on the web or use certificates.
