title: "redis-2.6.13-2.fc18 bugfix update"

Redis wasn't updated in some time. I pushed
[two](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/redis-2.6.13-2.fc18)
[updates](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/redis-2.6.13-2.fc19)
which include the latest upstream version, additionally I made an
attempt to unbundle jemalloc and build it using the PIE flag (hardened
build).

\
This build will need some additional testing because of these bigger
changes.\
Â Besides that redis is still bundling lua, linenoise and ... another
lib.
