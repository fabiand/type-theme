Mozilla\'s rust in Fedora\'s PPA Copr
=====================================

[Copr](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Copr) is Fedora's answer
to Ubuntu's PPA - IIUIC, so don't nail me on the definition.\
Slavek give's a [nice
introduction](http://bkabrda.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/introducing-copr-build-system/)
into how Copr works and what it does.\
\
Now - [Copr](http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/) can be used to
create public repositories for 3rd-party packages like rust - which can
not (yet) land in the official Fedora repos (in rusts's case because of
the bundling other libs).\
I had to uploaded a source rpm of rust and point Copr to it, so Copr can
pick it up and do a chroot build.\
Best is that Copr is also creating the appropriate repository and you
only need the following repo file to install rust with dnf or yum.\
\

    # Add the following repo file
    $ cat rust.repo 
    [fabiand-rust-unofficial]
    name=Rust packages (unofficial)
    baseurl=http://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/fabiand/rust/
    enabled=1
    metadata_expire=7d
    gpgcheck=0

    # And install it
    $ sudo dnf install rust

\
In general Copr seems to be nice - it's still abit rough around the
edges, but that's expected. It can surely imagine that t's going to fit
well into our existing infrastructure.\

\[Update\] The copr [landing page for
rust](http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/detail/fabiand/rust/)
and the package
[rust-0.6-2.fc18.x86\_64.rpm](http://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/fabiand/rust/fedora-18-x86_64/rust-0.6-2.fc18/rust-0.6-2.fc18.x86_64.rpm)
