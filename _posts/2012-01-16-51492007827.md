[Redis](http://www.redis.io/) -a very nice persistent key-value store
with knowledge about lists and sets - 2.4 brings some syntax change /
new features.\
If you are using redis on Fedora 16 you can test 2.4.6 using the
updates-testing repo:\

    # su -c 'yum update --enablerepo=updates-testing redis-2.4.6-1.fc16'

This update also introduces a systemd unit file, which could also get
some attention to see if it works like expected.\
\
This is the second sunny day with temperatures just above 0Â°c.
