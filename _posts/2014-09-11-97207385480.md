Node is moving.
===============

We visited [project atomic](http://) and the [btrfs idea of the systemd
cabal](http://). The first does not really fit and has issues in our
usecase, the latter is very bleeding edge. We visited them to evaluate
them for the next-gen [Node](http://www.ovirt.org/Node).

But before we come to approaches, let's take a brief look at *some*
issues. Node is everything. An image, an installer, a configuration UI,
a way of how a system can run. And that makes it hard to develop,
maintain, test and cumbersome to use. But I should note that it is doing
it's job well, beeing stable at runtime.

We believe that Node can be improved if we delegate responsibilities to
individual (existing) components. A drawback of this will be that
removing the high integration and going over to a more modular approach
will likely increase the size of the currently very small (\~250MB)
image.

In the next generation of Node, we are looking at the components to be
used in parts of Node

-   [anaconda](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda) to replace our
    own installer,
-   [puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/deploying-puppet-in-client-server-standalone-and-massively-scaled-environments)
    to do the system configuration (locally and central) instead of
    using our own classes,
-   [livemedia-creator](https://fedorahosted.org/lorax/)
    (oz/imagefactory) to build the appliance (and iso), and
-   [imgbased](http://github.com/fabiand/imgbased) to take care of
    persistence and multiple-images.

It is not yet set in stone. But the investigations we do are looking
promising. And not everything will change: Likely we'll keep our
`ovirt-node-setup` TUI (but we are also having an eye on anaconda's
`initial-setup`).

The outcome we expect is

-   less installer problems and maintenance burden as we rely on
    anaconda
-   less configuraiton bugs as we reuse the well maintained puppet
    classes, and can also contribute to them
-   less build problems because livemdia-creator is running the builds
    in isolated VMs
-   better runtime experience for users, because the filesystem will be
    writable
-   easier to integrate 3rd parties, because we aim to make the
    persistence transparent
-   better testability by delegating responsibilities
-   more distro agnostic

The biggest drawback will be the increased size. We don't know yet where
we will land, but lets throw 1 GB into the air. We will also - obviously
- be much more dependent on other components - but we don't fear that.

Much to come, and we are just starting. If you want to join, reach out
