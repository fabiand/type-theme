Yet another step towards image based updates using rpms:

    [root@localhost ~]# yum update
    …
    Installing:
     ovirt-node-ng-image-update     noarch     4.0.0-0.0.master.20160205.0.el7       jenkins.ovirt.org_job_ovirt-node-ng_master_build-artifacts-fc22-x86_64_lastSuccessfulBuild_artifact_exported-artifacts_     444 M
     replacing  ovirt-node-ng-image-update-placeholder.noarch 4.0.0-0.0.master
    …
    Total download size: 447 M
    Is this ok [y/d/N]: 

This is showing that an image update is available on jenkins, and Node
want's to pull it down.
