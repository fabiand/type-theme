Create some entities in Kubernetes:

    # Create the pod, services, persistent volumes, and claims
    $ kubectl create -f iscsi-demo-target-tgtd.yaml
    persistentvolumeclaim "disk-custom" created
    persistentvolumeclaim "disk-alpine" created
    persistentvolumeclaim "disk-cirros" created
    persistentvolume "iscsi-disk-custom" created
    persistentvolume "iscsi-disk-alpine" created
    persistentvolume "iscsi-disk-cirros" created
    service "iscsi-demo-target" created
    pod "iscsi-demo-target-tgtd" created

Now use a pod to access the created target:

    # Run a qemu instance to see if the target can be used
    # Note: This is not testing the PV or PVC, just the service and     target
    # Use ctrl-a c quit to quit
    $ kubectl run --rm -it qemu-test --image=kubevirt/libvirtd -- \
      qemu-system-x86_64 \
        -snapshot \
        -drive file=iscsi://iscsi-demo-target/iqn.2017-01.io.kubevirt:sn.42/2 \
        -nographic

And enjoy the boot:

    boot: 


    OpenRC 0.21.7.818fc79999 is starting up Linux 4.4.45-0-virtgrsec (x86_64)
    â€¦
    Welcome to Alpine Linux 3.5

Okay - It's not all end-to-end yet - when looking at it from a KubeVirt
perspective.

What you see is that a qemu instance is booting of an iSCSI target LUN,
offered by an iSCSI portal running as an unprivileged pod on a
Kubernetes cluster.

But that's already nice, what was achieved so far:

-   iSCSI target pod with demo content
-   Service, volumes, claims to expose the content
-   `qemu` can boot from the LUN
-   VM object can be created to boot of the LUN (if you specify the LUN)

The remaining gap ([which is being worked
on](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/109)) is to allow
specifying a claim in the VM object (instead of the LUN as we did it
above). And then we can use KubeVirt to boot a VM of a disk image -
probably.
