Finally we've got continous builds of [oVirt Node
Next](http://www.ovirt.org/Node/4.0) in [oVirt's jenkins
instance](http://jenkins.ovirt.org/user/fabiand/my-views/view/Node.next/job/ovirt-node-ng_master_build-artifacts-fc22-x86_64/)
which are consumable by Anaconda.

You want to try it? Read on.

Starting the anaconda installer
-------------------------------

Independently if you continue with a VM or a bare metal server, the host
you will use

-   needs at least 3GB of free space
-   is connected to the internet

### Using a VM

The safe way to try the oVirt Node Next is to install it into a VM, this
is quite easy:

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 dst.img 20G
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      -enable-kvm \
      -m 2048 \
      -cdrom http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/fabiand_boo_build_testing/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/ovirt-ipxe.iso \
      -hda dst.img \
      -serial stdio \
      -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::19090-:9090

Now select *"Interactive installation"* and wait for the anaconda
installer to come up, this can take a while, as data is downloaded from
the internet.

### Using bare metal (easy - iPXE ISO)

Trying oVirt node Next on bare metal is not much more difficult.

1.  Download our pre-built PXE ISO:
2.  Write the `ovirt-ipxe.iso` onto a CD-ROM, DVD, USB, virtual media
3.  Boot your bare metal server using the previously created media

Now select *"Interactive installation"* and wait for the anaconda
installer to come up, this can take a while, as data is downloaded from
the internet.

### Using bare metal (medium - CentOS 7 ISO + kernel arguments)

Trying oVirt Node Next on bare metal is not much more difficult.

1.  Grab a CentOS 7 (Node Next is based on CentOS 7) netinstall
    `boot.iso` from a [mirror close to
    you](http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7/os/x86_64/images/boot.iso).
2.  Boot the `boot.iso` on your bare metal server and wait for ISOLINUX
    bootloader
3.  Select the default entry and append the following arguments:
    `inst.ks=https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node-ng.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/kickstart/minimal-kickstart.ks;hb=HEAD inst.updates=http://jenkins.ovirt.org/job/fabiand_boo_build_testing/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/product.img/product.img inst.stage2=http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7/os/x86_64/`

Now wait for the anaconda installer to come up, this can take a while,
as data is downloaded from the internet.

Performing the installation
===========================

Once anaconda is up you need to answer a few questions

1.  Select your prefered language and continue
2.  On the next page, select your keyboard layout and timezone
3.  Select the disk to be used - Enter the spoke (the thing which opens
    when you click on the disk icon), and select the disk to use.
    Sometimes you need to deselect and select the disk icon again.
    **Note: Leave the partitioning to automatic. If you are brave you
    can do your own partitioning layout, but ensure to use LVM
    thin-provisioning.**

4.  Now you should have answered all necessary questions, and can
    proceed by hitting `Continue`

5.  The installation is started, use the time to at least set a *root*
    user password. **Note: The installation can take a while, because
    now the installation image is pulled from our jenkins instance
    (\~500MB).**
6.  Once the installation is done and you've set a password, you can
    reboot the host and it should be ready to use.

The host can now be added to Engine.

> **Note:** In case you encounter issues, enable permissive mode on the
> host by calling `setenforce 0`

Trying Cockpit
--------------

![](http://www.ovirt.org/images/8/87/Cockpit-node.png)

This is an early preview with cockpit installed. But currently cockpit
is not enabled and the firewall prevents access. Yes, it will be fixed.
Until then: Perform the following steps to take a look at cockpit:

1.  Use the VM installation above
2.  After installation, log intot the VM
3.  Start cockpit: `systemctl start cockpit`
4.  Stop firewalld: `systemctl stop firewalld`
5.  Browse to (on the host, not inside the VM), this request will be
    forwarded to port 9090 inside the VM, where cockpit is running.

Feedback
--------

Is this working for you or not? Could you install Node? Could you add
Node? Could you browse Cockpit? Or did your host explode?

Let us know on IRC (irc://irc.oftc.net/\#ovirt) or via email
(users\@ovirt.org) what you think.

Next steps
----------

The next big step is to enable updates.
