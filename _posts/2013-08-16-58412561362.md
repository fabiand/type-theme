title: "Secure Simple Pairing with IPSec - that would be nice."
author: fabiand

Why can't establishing a local (or global) IPSec connection be as easy
as Bluetooths [Secure Simple
Pairing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Pairing_mechanisms)?

This would be ideal for quickly establishing a secure connection between
two devices. After the pairing the last challenge in keeping the global
conneciton is traversing the middle boxes. But at least the secure key
exchange already happened, and with numeric comparison you even can
prevent MITM attacks.

This can happen at e.g. conferences or so. Anytime we meet face to face,
or got another out-of-band channel.
