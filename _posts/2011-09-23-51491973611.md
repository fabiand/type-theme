Poll, no poll, poll.
====================

While working on gswitcheroo I needed a reliable way to determine if a
monitor get's connected to the HDMI port of the discrete card. But
monitoring the HDMI port when the corresponding discrete card is powered
off, doesn't seem to work.\
A temporary solution is to power on the discrete card once and again, to
see if a some monitor got connected.
[airlied](http://airlied.livejournal.com/) point out, that maybe the
integrated card is able to detect connected monitors. But in the first
trial it didn't really work.\
\
What also didn't work, was monitoring status changes of the discrete
(radeon) card using udev (using `udevadm monitor`).Â  Time for more
investigations.
