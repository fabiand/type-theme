Building gcc-4.3.4 on Fedora 15
===============================

Currently you need to rely on proprietary drivers to use CUDA or OpenCL
on a GPU under Linux.\
\
There is [clover](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~steckdenis/clover/) a
OpenCL implementation capable of running on a CPU - but in my case I had
to use CUDA. And CUDA requires gcc 4.3.4, which is not available for
Fedora 15 natively, so we have to build it our self.\
Actually it is quite straight to build it.\
Install some requirements:

    $ sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686 glibc-devel.x86_64 \
        gmp-devel mpfr-devel

Fetch the source:

    $ mkdir gcc
    $ cd gcc
    $ curl -O \
       "ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/gcc/releases/gcc-4.3.4/gcc-4.3.4.tar.bz2"

And finally configure, build and install it. It took around 20minutes on
my machine. I installed this gcc version not in my native PATH, as I
didn't want any collisions, I choose *../build* as a suitable
destination. In this case you have to remember to modify your PATH and
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables. So the app (e.g. nvcc) in
question is looking in the right path when calling gcc.

    $ export DST="${PWD}/../build"
    $ mkdir "$DST"
    $ nice ./configure --prefix="$DST" \
        --with-gmp=/usr/lib/ --with-mpc=/usr/lib/ --with-mpfr=/usr/lib/
    $ nice make -j8
    $ make install

I can also consider adding the *--program-suffix=4.3.4* to add the given
suffix to all binaries, this makes sense when you install this build
into %{\_bindir} and %{\_libdir}.\
Finally you can launch *nvcc* or whatever application is requiring
gcc-4.3.4.

    $ PATH="${DST}/bin:$PATH" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${DST}/lib64:${DST}/lib" \
        nvcc [...]
