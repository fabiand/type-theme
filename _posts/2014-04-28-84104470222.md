[clpeak](https://github.com/krrishnarraj/clpeak) is a new tool in Fedora
to measure the peak values of several OpenCL related aspects, i.e. IOPS,
FLOPS, memory bandwidth and kernel latency.

It works [quiet](https://github.com/pocl/pocl/issues/72) nicely with
pocl and Mesa's Clover (for AMD R600+) - all on Fedora.

The builds have landed in Fedora 20+ and can be installed using the
common ways i.e.:

    $ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing clpeak

clpeak and clinfo are now two wonderful tools to get basic informations
about the OpenCL capabilities of your host.
