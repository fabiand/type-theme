title: "bookzilla instead of amazon"

This is nothing new, actually uncovered last year already. But today I
just saw it again, and some aspects are just not what I want to support
with my kaufkraft/buying power. And that is actually our - consumers -
best weapon: Where we spend our money.

So, time to re-activate my bookzilla account, which is also supporting
F/LOSS.

[![Bookzilla](https://media.shop-asp.de/shop/magazine-pictures/bookzilla_neu_200_0.gif)](http://www.bookzilla.de)

There is surely the possibility of using those sub-shops of amazon which
also support F/LOSS, but those sub-shops will still use amazon's
infrastructure and "huma ressources", which ain't what I want.

But I must admit that I am not sure how the workers at libri/bookzilla
are treated.
