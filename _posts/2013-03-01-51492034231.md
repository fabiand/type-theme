\
Node 2.6.1- a very slim firmware-like Fedora for oVirt Node - has been
released.\
This minor release was necessary because our major TUI rework introduced
a security hole. [Get it
here](http://www.ovirt.org/Node#Current_Release).\
\
So whats new about Node 2.6.x?\
Well, we've got plugins and a new TUI (a new installer TUI will follow
shortly).\
More can be found in the [release
notes](http://www.ovirt.org/Node_Release_Notes).\
\
And whats coming up?\
It obvious that a "solid core" or this "firmware like\"Â  properties of
Node are well suited for other projects as well (think of OpenStack,
Gluster, ...)\
So a near term goal is to dro the oVirt specific bits (like vdsm) to
make Node more general and easier to use for other projects.\
And the new installer shall also land.
