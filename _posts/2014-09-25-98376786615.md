Nice paintings from daala - intra prediction and complexity
===========================================================

[![Intra-Paint](https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/paint_demo/paint_crepuscular16.jpg)](https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/paint_demo/)

daala was actually the reason why I started with packaging [OpenCL for
Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OpenCL). daala planned to
provide an OpenCL based reference implementation, but there was a lack
of platforms supporting OpenCL.

Anyhow, Jean-Marc Valin wrote about an algorithm yesterday which is
visually quite impressive, but it's also complex. On the pro side is,
that it is massively parallel - which actually directly redirects us to
OpenCL. Sadly I won't be able to contribute something, but at least that
is a niche, where OpenCL can help.

The results of the algorithm are quite nice (see at the bottom of the
post), and might be practical if the complexity can be addressed.
