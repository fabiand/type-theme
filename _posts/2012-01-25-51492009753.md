\
\
[Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala), as some of you may know, is a
"compiler for the GObject type system". This means, vala is providing a
high-level language with e.g. literals for (nearly) all features of
gobject and glib. Because vala get's translated to C, it easily
integrates with existing C code. Vala code can also be used from C (and
other languages, most easily using gobject intropsection) too.\
\
[Gstreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a nice multimedia
framework - and component of the GNOME ecosystem, now more related to
[freedesktop.org](http://freedesktop.org/) - and is also based on
gobject/glib. So it is quite obvious to use vala to build gstreamer
plugins and elements.\
\
A gstreamer plugin is organized as a plugin, which wraps one or more
elements, which provide the actual functionality. Detailed informations
on how to write plugins can be found in the [plugin writers
guide](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/).\
\
But what is needed to write a plugin and elements in vala? And if it's
good to do so.\
\
**gst\_plugin\_desc and plugin\_init ()**\
There are two special structures that need to appear in a Gstreamer
plugin: A plugin description (namely the `Gst.PluginDesc` \[vala
class\]) and the `plugin_init ()` function.\
The identifiers of these structures (struct and function) need to match
those expected by gstreamer. The plugin description identifier needs to
be called `gst_plugin_desc` and the `plugin_init()` function also needs
to have this name.\
In vala it is important to place these methods on the toplevel of your
file, and not within a namespace, otherwise vala will prefix the
resulting C functions with prefix dervied from the namespace. An
alternative is to use a CCode attribute for those structures, but why do
this if it can be done easier (as described before).\
An working example with correctly named plugin description and init
function can be found
[here](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/gst-plugins-cl/blobs/master/src/gstopencl.vala).\
\
**Namespace**\
Because of the naming you should also put your elements of the plugin
within a Gst namespace e.g. namespace Gst.Myplugin. Because this
translates to C structures (generated by vala) prefixed by
gst\_myplugin\_... and the gst (or Gst or GST) prefix is needed, because
the buildsystem is looking for those symbols and exports them.\
Look in the example above or below to see where to put the element and
what kind of namespace to use.\
\
**Elements: Gst.BaseTransform**\
It's quite easy to implement a simple filter. This can be done by
subclassing Gst.BaseTransform and overriding (so providing an
implementation for) a couple of functions. Have a look
[here](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gstreamer-libs/html/GstBaseTransform.html)
to find out what you need to implement. Or
[here](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/gst-plugins-cl/blobs/master/src/clkernel.vala)
to see an actual working implementation.\
\
**gst-template and buildsystem**\
You can use the [plugin
template](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-template/) provided
by gstreamer but you obviously need to modify the buildsystem to
generate c code from the vala files.\
Have a look at this
[Makefile.am](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/gst-plugins-cl/blobs/master/src/Makefile.am).\
\
**Packages & Testing**\
The basic requirements can be met with the following packages:\
\

    $ sudo yum install gstreamer-devel \
    gstreamer-plugins-base-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel-docs \
    vala devhelp

\
Have you finally compiled your sources try the plugin with gst-launch,
remember to add the hidden .libs dir to your path:\

    $GST_PLUGIN_PATH=src/.libs/ gst-launch  videotestsrc ! myelem ! autovideosink

\
So yes - you can write gstreamer plugins in vala - so what element are
you going to write today?
