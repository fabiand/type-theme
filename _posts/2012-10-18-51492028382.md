[gcalctool](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gcalctool) is the friendly
calculater in [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/). And now - after several
others (at least cheese, zeitgeist, gnome-games)- it is ported to
[vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala)! Wow.\
\
This didn't happen out of the blue, it was someone actually doing it -
[bobthegnome](http://bobthegnome.blogspot.de/) and PioneerAxon made this
happen.\
What does this mean? gcalctool should be easier to maintain and maybe
attract even more contributors, as you don't have to deal with the whole
[boilerplate](http://www.gtk.org/). And - Vala is gaining momentum.
Nice. Cheers.\
