\
Virtualization is already an ubiquitous technique.\
Fedora provides packages for many of the Linux virtualization components
through the yum virtualization group.\

    $ sudo yum groupinstall virtualization

\
Well, anyway - When doing virtualization you need a *host*, hosting your
virtualized guests. If you don't want to do this on your local machine -
because it hasn't got the capabilities, isn't beefy enough, ... - you
can use [oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org/) Node as a hypervisor on a second
machine which you can easily manage from Fedora using virt-manager.\
This can be useful for a small working group or developers.\
\
oVirt Node is based on Fedora and optimized to quickly get a hypervisor
up an running. You actually do not need to care about all the
constraints - networking, services, storage, ... - you need to consider
if you setup a hypervisor yourself (which can also be done with 
Fedora). It is also stripped down (\~150MB) to preserve most of the RAM
and storage space to the virtualized guests.\
\
Anyhow:\

[Download](http://ovirt.org/releases/stable/binary/) oVirt Node

Install it on a machine with a recent Intel or AMD processor

Log into the installed Node using admin and

Configure a network interface

Press F2 to drop to the console and run

`/usr/libexec/ovirt-config-password` 

1.  set a root password
2.  enable SSH access

Optional: `ssh-copy-id` your ssh key to node to allow a password-less
login

User virt-manager to create a new connection (File -\> New Connection)
to the installed Node (IP can be found on the Node's Status page)\
URI: `qemu+ssh://$OVIRTNODE/system`

(\$OVIRTNODE needs to replaced accordingly)\
Actually oVirt Node is intended to be used with oVirt Engine, which can
manage from one up to a couple of hundreds (?) of Nodes.\
But the Engine setup itself is not as easy as just using virt-manager
:)\
At least - Engine would be the next step to get used to the oVirt
components.\
\
P.s.: You can use `virsh vol-upload` to get some data onto the node.
