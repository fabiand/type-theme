[Presence](http://dummdida.blogspot.com/p/presence.html) - a small vala,
gstreamer, clutter and dirac/schroedinger - based bi-directional video
tool, is configurable now.\
\
You can actually use it to establish uni- or bi-directional audio/video
streams in trusted/local networks. Sometimes this can be handy, as those
streams can be set-up to have a much better quality than generic VoIP
solutions ...\
You can even receive more than one stream.\
\
Currently you can adjust the video size, the compression quality and the
framerate to get the optimal balance between performance and
capabilities of the underlying hardware.\
A next thing is to tune those parameters automagically - but I'll need
to find out how to detect dropped frames or an increased latency.
Additional there should be a way to adjust the latency/buffer on the
receiving side, to match the amount of data coming in.\

Find it on [gitorious](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/presence).
