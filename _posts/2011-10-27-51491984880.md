substanziell - Backup your subatance.io document.
=================================================

[substance.io](http://www.substance.io/) is a nice *document authoring
and publishing for the web* - but sometimes it has it hickups and you
can loose parts of your document. No good, but - hey - let's make
backups.\
After exporting your cookies (using some Export cookies Firefox add-on),
you can use the following **while**-loop to backup your progress
regularly into a a clean git repository.\

    while true ; 
    do \
      curl -O -b cookies.txt \
        http://substance.io/$USERNAME/$DOCUMENTNAME.latex ; \
      git commit -asm"Auto-save." ; \
      sleep 60 ; \
    done

And thanks to \_mql for getting back some lost lines.
