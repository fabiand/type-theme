title: "v2v-job v0.2.0 POC for importing VMs into KubeVirt"
author: fabiand
---



KubeVirt becomes usable. And to make it easier to use it would be nice
to be able to import existing VMs. After all migration is a strong point
of KubeVirt.

[`virt-v2v`](http://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v.1.html) is the tool of
choice to convert some guest to run on the KVM hypervisor. What a great
fit.

Thus recently I started a [little
POC](https://github.com/fabiand/v2v-job) to check if this would really
work.

This post is just to wrap it up, as I just tagged v0.2.0 and finished a
nice OVA import.

What the POC does:

-   Take an URL pointing to an OVA
-   Download and convert the OVA to a domxml and raw disk image
-   Create a PVC and move the raw disk image to it
-   Create an
    [OfflineVirtualMachine](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/667)
    from the domxml using xslt

This is pretty straight forward and currently living in a Job which can
be found here: <https://github.com/fabiand/v2v-job>

It's actually using an [OpenShift
Template](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html),
but only works on Kubernetes so far, because I didn't finish the RBAC
profiles. However, using the `oc` tool you can even run it on Kubernetes
without Template support by using:

    $ oc process --local -f manifests/template.yaml \
        -p SOURCE_TYPE=ova \
        -p SOURCE_NAME=http://192.168.42.1:8000/my.ova \
      | kubectl apply -f -
    serviceaccount "kubevirt-privileged" created
    job "v2v" created

The interested reader can take a peek at the whole process in [this
log](https://gist.github.com/fabiand/49db654c78c9c3b5597eb14cb0f8783c).

And btw - This [little but awesome patch on
libguestfs](https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commit/286b88891c2288fb7f64c9538296599ece04bcb1)
by Pino - will help this job to auto-detect - well, guess - the the
guest operating system and set the OfflineVirtualMachine
[annotations](https://kubevirt.gitbooks.io/user-guide/guest-os-info.html)
correctly, in order to then - at runtime - apply the right
[VirtualMachinePresets](https://kubevirt.gitbooks.io/user-guide/vm-presets.html),
in order to launch the guest with optimized defaults.
