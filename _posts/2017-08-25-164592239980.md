[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/) is a nice tool to
demo Kubernetes - running Virtual Machines with Kubevirt.

And as it's a regular Kubernetes cluster - just with a single node -
thus we can also use it to demo [KubeVirt](http://kubevirt.io).

It was a little work, but now there is a WIP branch to move the KubeVirt
demo to minikube
[here](https://github.com/fabiand/kubevirt-demo/tree/withMinikube).

Or try it yourself in a few [simple
steps](https://github.com/fabiand/kubevirt-demo/tree/withMinikube#quickstart):

    $ git clone -b withMinikube \
      https://github.com/fabiand/kubevirt-demo.git
    $ cd kubevirt-demo
    # See the README.md of how to setup minikube for this demo
    $ ./run-demo.sh

And this is how it looks if you try it out yourself:

Feedback is welcome!

As it's not mentioned in the recording, the VMs are defined in yaml
files like pods, for an example, take a look
[here](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/master/cluster/vm.yaml).
