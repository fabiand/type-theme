Working on [oVirt Node](http://www.ovirt.org/) is nice, this minimal,
firmware like, rock-solid, (non-official) Fedora "spin", is oVirts
"hypervisor".\
\
One challenge is to keep Node rock-solid.\
Typically you can add unit tests to your software to shield yourself
from regressions (or at least discover them early) but adding tests to
Node wasn't that easy as Node is a complete "operating system" and not
just one component. It is currently composed of approximately 450
packages - all of these change independetly.\
\
We were looking for a way to automate [some basic tests on development
or released images](http://wiki.ovirt.org/wiki/Node_Testing). But a
requirement to run the tests is a running Node. This means testing
requires an installation (and subsequent a removal or "freeing" of th
eused host) on different hardware, including virtual machines.\
So we needed a tool that could control the whole life-cycle (provision,
run tests, and freeing) of a machine (either real or virtual) and which
is also monitoring the progress of a testsuite, to act accordingly (e.g.
killing it if it times out).\
We did not find such a tool and came up with igor.\

Igor expects a working PXE environment (so a lan with some DHCP and PXE
server like Cobbler) and some hosts or a libvirtd instance. It is
expected that all hosts (real and virtual) boot via PXE from the PXE
server.\

\
In such an environemtn Igor can control the PXE server to modify the
configuration for existing hosts (or add configuration for short-living
hosts like a VM) to install an oVirt Node image.\
After changing the PXE configuration and booting up the host Igor steps
back and either waits for a controlled ending of the testsuite (signaled
via a RESTlike API) or a timeout. When it receives such a signal it
shuts down the host and restores the original PXE configuration.\
\
So that's a first build-block of how we automated the testing of oVirt
Node. I haven't gone into detail how the testcases look like and how we
are actually testing our TUI. Also I didn't mention the client which is
running on (an edited) oVirt Node image tu actually run the tests.\
\
Igor can be found [here](https://gitorious.org/ovirt/igord) and is
intended to be used on a developers machine (or in conjuction with
[jenkins](http://www.jenkins-ci.org/)).\
\
p.s.: It is getting interesting when Igor is paired with a client using
[python-uinput](https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput) to
inject mouse and keyboard events.
