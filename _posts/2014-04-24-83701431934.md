title: "i915 and radeon both enabled on vgaswitcheroo at boot"

That is the title of [bug
896400](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=896400). The problem
described there is that after some kernel changes all cards in a
"switcheroo" setup are activated at boot. because of this some laptops -
including mine - boot into a black screen.

A comment notes that some involved developers favor a userspace
solution, instead of a kernel space based one, I haven't checked that,
but at least [one of the
comments](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=896400#c9) gave me
a hint how to make the laptop usable again - for non-linux-users.

I was able to let my laptop boot with the integrated i915 graphics card
again by appending

    radeon.modeset=0 radeon.dpm=1 radeon.aspm=1 radeon.runpm=1

To the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` in `/etc/default/grub` and re-run
`grub2-mkconfig`.

    $ vi /etc/default/grub
    $ grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/default/grub

That way the radeon card is in a state where vgaswitcheroo is not
initialized at boot time, and the i915 wins. If you want to boot with
the radeon card instead, just append

    i915.modeset=0

**Update**: Rephrased a sentence to not put all kernel developers into
one bucket.
