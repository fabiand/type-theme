[Presence](http://dummdida.blogspot.de/p/presence.html) is a small - but
yet flexible - tool to do simple and high-quality streaming (using
dirac+vorbis over RTP) in a local broadcast domain.\
When not using the MDNS feature this can also be endpoints on any
routable network.\
Not shown on in the screen shot, but a feature, is picture-in-picture
mode for secondary streams.\
\
Anyhow, this new release (0.4.8) contains an improvement related to
publishing a stream. It's now done in two clicks with reasonable
defaults, even for low-end machines.\
\
Install or update it now on Fedora 16/17/18:\

    $ sudo yum clean metadata
    $ sudo yum install --enablerepo=updates-testing presence
    # or
    $ sudo yum update --enablerepo=updates-testing presence

\
Or - hero-like -using [this one-click
technology](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/applications/Presence).\
\
The release was motivated by my new [Logitech HD Pro Webcam
C920](http://www.logitech.com/de-de/webcam-communications/webcams/hd-pro-webcam-c920)
which is working out of the box on Fedora - so YUV and MJPEG besides the
(unsupported) h.264 support.\

When looking at the video quality of this camera and two built-in
cameras of laptops, this is clearly a big step forward in image quality
- So a decent camera is always a good way to improve a video conference.

As said, the video quality is great - and using MJPEG it can deliver a
720p video with up to 24fps, so ideal for telepresence.
