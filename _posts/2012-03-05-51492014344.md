They did it. A smallish OpenCL example running on Mesa\'s r600.

This happened somewhat unexpected while looking again at the state of
open OpenCL implementations (so pocl and clover).\
\
Suddenly some hero told me that there is a smallish OpenCL example which
actually works with Mesa's OpenCL implementation (actually this is bound
to r600 based devices). So what is awesome if this ain't?\
\
What you need:\

-   tstellar's
    [*clover-r600-master*](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Etstellar/mesa/?h=clover-r600-master)
    branch
-   *Fedora 16* (okay, it might also work somewhere else), with rawhide
    clang and llvm
-   and the [example
    code](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Etstellar/opencl-example/)
-   oh - and - important -Â  an appropriate card e.g. HD6310 (AMD
    E-350/E-450) or some other evergreen GPU

\
What actually has to be done is - this time - left to the user.\
A few hints:\

-   Look at the comment in line 96 of
    src/gallium/state\_trackers/clover/llvm/invocation.cpp and swap
    comments (there are r600
    [patches](http://people.freedesktop.org/%7Etstellar/) for LLVM which
    can be applied to get around this).
-   The implementation expects the opencl libs to reside in
    /usr/local/lib/opencl - so install or softlink
-   Set LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to mesa/lib when building the example
-   You need to provide the OpenCL headers

The present support is currently just basic, but it's awesome to see
this progress.\
\
What you get:\
\

    There are 1 platforms.
    There are 1 GPU devices.
    clCreateContext() succeeded.
    notkernel
    main
    clCreateCommandQueue() succeeded.
    clCreateProgramWithSource() suceeded.
    build log:
    clBuildProgram() suceeded.
    clCreateKernel() suceeded.
    clCreateBuffer() succeeded.
    clSetKernelArg() succeeded.
    --------------------------------------------------
    [...]
    clEnqueueReadBuffer() suceeded.
    pi = 3.141590

\
Let's see when I can build
[gst-plugins-opencl](http://dummdida.blogspot.com/2012/02/gst-plugins-cl-opencl-plugins-for.html)
against mesa. And "they" include zack, steckdenis, and tstellar.\
\
Some more informations using
[this](http://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Eyoel/notes/clInfo.c) tool:\

    $ make clInfo CFLAGS="-I$PATH_TO_CL_HEADERS" LDFLAGS="-lOpenCL -L$MESAPATH/lib"
    $ sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MESAPATH/lib" ./clInfo
    Found 1 platform(s).
    platform[(nil)]: profile: FULL_PROFILE
