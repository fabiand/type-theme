I got my hands on a Lenovo x121e (5051) - an AMD Fusion E-350 powered
laptop. So how does Fedora ~~16 Alpha~~ 15 on that device?\
\
**Reasons?** Much new things to test: EFI, AMD Fusion E-350, HDMI + VGA.
And a quite low price tag at about â‚¬ 360.\
Like Fedora somewhat on the bleeding edge.\
\
**What works?** Everything I tested so far. Wireless (Atheros), Graphics
(ATI Radeon), Harddrive, USB, ...\
And all those shiny things worked *out of the box (!)*. No manual
intervention needed, so a silent a cautious **A+**.\
\
**What doesn't?** I just noticed some graphics glitches in gnome-shell,
but maybe those will get fixed until the final release.\
\
**EFI:** I could boot into Fedora 16 Alpha Live Desktop using the legacy
fallback. EFI seems to work, but there are currently
[issues](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735023) booting
Fedora 16 with EFI, so I went back and use Fedora 15 updates-testing
booted via EFI and BTRFS partitions.
