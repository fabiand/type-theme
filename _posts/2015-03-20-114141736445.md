Quick notes: You need EPEL 7 and you need the preview repo:

    yum install -y https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
    yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/sgallagh/cockpit-preview/repo/epel-7/sgallagh-cockpit-preview-epel-7.repo

    yum install --nogpgcheck -y cockpit

And you are good.
