[oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org/) - maybe you've heard about it. It's a
project to create an open IaaS "virtualization management system" - So a
bit like OpenStack, but different.\
Fedora is the base for oVirt's hypervisor: "Node". Basicaly this is a
stripped down Fedora, enriched with a couple of packages to prvide just
enough to host some virtual guests and do some basic configuration.\
\
Personally I'd like to use Node in conjunction with Gnome Boxes or
virt-manager. But this is currently not possible - but we might get
closer to it when solving [this
bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=810272).\
Anyhow, to quickly [install oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org/get-ovirt/) Node
you just need to add two (or three) additional kernel arguments:\

    BOOTIF=ethX storage_init

You should/could also add\

    adminpw=$ADMINPW

\
`ADMINPW=$(openssl passwd -salt SALT)` is a salted password, so you can
log in (as `admin`) after the installation. Alternatively you can boot
into single mode to reset the password.\
\
The parameters above install oVirt node without user intervention,Â 
setup networking on ethX and *erase all data on the disk* and create a
defautl (lvm based) partitioning scheme.\
The next step would be adding Node to oVirt Engine - or wait until it
can be managed by virt-manager, which is much quicker to set-up :)
