It has never been easier to use a [Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/)
repository with the [Copr plugin for
dnf](http://dnf.baseurl.org/2014/03/19/copr-plugin/).

To enable a copr repo on your local host you just need to run:

    dnf copr enable bkabrda/python-3.4 fedora-20-x86_64

And if you ain't sure what repo to enable just try

    dnf copr search rust

Once the repository is enabled, it is also available to the other
yum/rpm based tools, like `yum` and `pkcon`.
