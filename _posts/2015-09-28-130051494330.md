Alcatel One Touch Fire E / Firefox OS - Retrospective
=====================================================

My first Firefox OS device was the [Geeksphone
Revolution](http://dummdida.tumblr.com/post/86332938365/geeksphone-revolution).
Hardware wise it was a quite nice device, but the size just didn't fit
my hand and so I droped it a few times until the display was broken.

At that time - beginning of 2015 - I rather tended to go with anohther
Firefox OS phone. Luckily the [Alcatel One Touch Fire
E](https://firefoxosdevices.org/de/alcatel-one-touch-fire-e/) got
introduced at that time and I went with it (paying around â‚¬ 120,-).

So, now, a few months later I need to send in my device because the
touchscreen does take my touches anymore. In the light of [Matej's
earlier post](https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/firefox-os-post-mortem.html)
I take the occassion to share my experienceswith Firefox OS 1.3 (and
later 1.4).

Some good:

-   Firefox OS is simple - Nothing is really deeply nested, or I hadn't
    had any trouble figuring stuff out
-   The camera app was fine, the fotos were actually quite good - but it
    was simple
-   The battery runtime was quite good, 2 days at normal usage, or half
    a day at full-time usage.
-   Tethering was actually working remarkably well over USB and wireless
    (hotspot-mode)
-   The Alcatel phone itself was a quite nice piece of hardware
-   Considering that Mozilla started from scratch, they did an awesome
    job to deliver the experience you have today on Firefox OS

Some bad:

-   The browser was quite fast to render, but to simple. No privacy
    tabs, tabs in general were hard to close, I missed the read mode
    several times every week.
-   The lack of decent apps - It's surely a chicken and an egg problem,
    but maybe Motzilla could consider to provide supported apps for the
    "most important" apps on Android, to enable Firefox OS users to
    communicate with their Android peers (I'm mainly looking a OpenWapp
    here)
-   A few times I dropped calls, because the button to drop a call is so
    close to the edges of the screen.
-   Sometimes, the phone becomes slow, with no obvious reasons.
-   WebRTC was not yet supported on my firmware
-   Calling a contact involved two taps (first on the contact, then on
    ethe number you want to dial). This might sound picky, but is also
    annoying after some time.

At the bottom line Firefox OS was *okay*, but I am really missing a
decent phone for it. The "complete package" is not right yet - A bit
more polished and stronger phone might make the experience better.

For now I'm going with an Android budget phone, but I am ready to grab
any new Firefox OS if it is a poiece of decent hardware,
