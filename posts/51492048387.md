\
My focus over the last year or so lay on bringing test automation to
oVirt Node.\
It was challenging because [oVirt Node](http://www.ovirt.org/Node) is
based on a LiveCD - at boot and post-installtion. (The whole LiveCD is
used as a r/o rootfs.)\
\
To allow an automated testing of oVirt Node, I've been working on
[igor](https://gitorious.org/ovirt/igord). It allows us to test oVirt
Node on real hardware an in VMs.\
\
When you throw all the new features (see below - libvirt-only, new
igorc, new igor events service, junit-reports for jobs) together you can
do a complete testsuite run on an oVirt Node ISO with one command.\
\
And this is how it looks (view it in fullscreen to see all the nifty
details, but this will leave you without the
[subtitles](http://fabiand.fedorapeople.org/igor/Bildschirmaufzeichnung%20von%2025.04.2013%2013:28:28.webm.srt)
explaining what's happening):\

ocmpletion of the first testcase, which is then picked up by igorc

completed (left) and a reboot is initiated (by the igor-service within

00:03:46,000 --\> 00:03:59,000 All testcases passed and the VM is torn
down by igord

This is a big step forward - even if there are still some issues
outstanding to achieve the goal to make testcase development fun.\
\
Now that we've seen the fancy part some background and open issues.\
One pitfall - up to this week - was the hurdle to get igor up an
running. Igor used to require Cobbler - and cobbler is not easy to setup
on Fedora 18 (which I use to build an test oVirt Node - which itself is
based on Fedora 18 packages).\
\
Anyhow - long story short - Igor has a "feature complete" "backend" for
libvirt now, that means, igor doesn't need cobbler anymore. Furthermore
I've added a brand new igor client (called igorc) which communicates
with igord (the daemon doing all the coordination work).\
This client has some "advanced" featuresÂ  like pretty printing of junit
results (Igor offers the result of the testruns in junit's XML format).\
\
Some open issues:\

-   ovirt-node needs a target to build a testable ISO
-   igor needs a feature to upload testsuites from the client side

All of this is up in the igor repository. ovirt-node related patches
(e.g. merging of the igor plugin are pending). Just follow the
[node-devel ml](http://lists.ovirt.org/pipermail/node-devel/) to see
when is is ready for daily usage.\
That's it for now - thanks for watching.
