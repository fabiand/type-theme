The day the net neutrality died?

Note: I am not sure if this is really a net neutrality issue. But it
smells like one.

One of the internet providers around is providing a dual-stack IPv6
connectivity for some of their offerings. Some of these IPv6 offerings
are connected to an "up to 16 Mbit/s downlink".

One of these offerings is a plain "internet and phone" offering, another
one is a classic triple-play "internet, phone and tv".

Today I learned that those 16 Mbit/s are "reserved" for the triple-play
offerings, and (in some areas) not available to the plain offerings.

Woot!? Do I really need to sign the triple-play offering to get a 16
Mbit/s downlink? Let's see what the customer service says.
