I just needed a quick way to get an overview over the lifetime of a
specific instance of a [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) class.\
Thus I need some informations about it's creation - and more important -
it's destruction time.\
robster pointed me to
[gobject-list](http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/danni/gobject-list.git/)
a small library which is preloaded and tracks gobjects' *\_ref* and
*\_unref* calls - so a great tool for vala code.\
\
It's simple to get it up and running on Fedora:\

    $ sudo yum install libunwind-devel glib2-devel
    $ git clone git://git.collabora.co.uk/git/user/danni/gobject-list.git
    $ make
    ...
    $ cd /path/to/myapp/
    $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libgobject-list.so myvalaapp | grep MyClass

\
More can be found in Danielle's initial
[post](http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2011/02/17/ld_preload-gobject-lifetime-debugging-tool/)
and more about vala's memory management can be found
[here](https://live.gnome.org/Vala/ReferenceHandling%20).\
