Using lokkit to handle your firewall.
=====================================

Some common thing is to turn of the firewall if a freshly installed
machine isn't reachable from the outside, as fidling with iptables is
not everyones passion.\
\
*lokkit* is another way to open some ports to the public.\
\
Just use\

    $ sudo lokkit --list-services

\
to see what services/ports can be managed/opened using lokkit. For me
it's quite common to open ports for ssh, ipsec and mdns afer a fresh
installation\
\

    $ sudo lokkit -s ssh
    $ sudo lokkit -s mdns
    $ sudo lokkit -s ipsec

\
Let's see if there will be something
[new](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FirewallD/) in the near future to
[handle](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/firewalld) - somtimes
quite complex (see virtualization) - iptable setups.
