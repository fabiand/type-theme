How to get a link to your public hardware data (smolt profile).
===============================================================

[Smolt](http://smolts.org/) is a
[tool](https://fedorahosted.org/smolt/wiki) to gather data about your
hardware in a distribution independent way. Hardware data can be
interesting for a couple of reasons, e.g. developers get detailed
informations about hardware involved in bugs.\
When opted-in, a smolt profile is created for your hardware after the
installation, on the first boot (via firstboot). There is
`smoltSendProfile` (part of the smolt package), which can be used to
re-send your hw data.\
But there is no easy way to get a link to your public profile - this
should be [changed](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=757515),
but until then ..\
- if you are interested - you can use the following lines, to determine
the URL to your public profile:\

    $ python import sys
    sys.path.append ("/usr/share/smolt/client")
    import smolt 
    print (smolt.get_profile_link(smolt.smoonURL, smolt.getPubUUID ()))
    EOF
