From a Dockerfile to a VM
=========================

The idea is simple: Let's use a Dockerfile to specify a VM image.

This can be useful in a few cases, i.e. beeing able to quickly reproduce
a VM (image).

Easy way to distribute VMs. Vagrant is actually doing something like
this.

This little tool above is now taking a Dockerfile to transform it into
an image which is suitable for a VM.

The flow is common:

    $ vocker build --tag simple
    crazy_planet
    $ vocker run -i crazy_planet
