CeBIT 2015 retrospective
========================

On Monday I visited this years CeBIT. The first time after three or so
years.

As usual most of the big vendors were represented. Over at the IBM booth
I looked if could find oVirt on Power8, but the only thing they were
demonstrating were RHEL 7 (and some other distors) on Power8.

The open source party was quite small. Just a few booths, far fewer than
a few years ago. But there were and are some quite interesting talks at
the Open Source Forum - including a couple of talks from Jon 'maddog'
Hall, Klaus Knopper and a few others - look at the schedule
[here](http://www.cebit.de/veranstaltung/open-source-forum/FOR/61524).

At the end of the day - and 45minutes delayed - I had a short session
([slides](https://fedorapeople.org/~fabiand/slides/2015-03-CeBIT-IntroductionToOVirt.pdf))
about oVirt. The audience was small, but they seemed to be interested in
oVirt and a couple of them seemed to get back to it.

A real highlight? No, sorry, I did not see any. For oVirt it was good to
show up at an exhibition like this. You are visible to an audience which
is normally not present at the f/loss conferences we usually have.

And about the future of Open Source at CeBIT? I am not sure. To me it
looks like the global vision on what Open Source want's to represent at
CeBIT is somewhat missing.
