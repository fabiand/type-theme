LinOTP and html5-google-authenticator (on Firefox OS)
=====================================================

The
[html5-google-authenticator](https://github.com/gbraad/html5-google-authenticator)
can be used with LinOTP for two-factor authentication.

But LinOTP takes a "seed", and the app a "secret". They are not the same
string, but different ones. This
[script](https://github.com/mcepl/gen-oath-safe/blob/master/gen-oath-safe)
can be used to generate both.
