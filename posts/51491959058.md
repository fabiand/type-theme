Klein - Elementary things.
==========================

[Elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/) always caught or users
attention because of it's design principles, which lead to a very
[aesthetic appearance](http://elementaryos.org/discover) (including the
gtk elementary theme) and some very nice applications like
[postler](http://elementaryos.org/journal/sneak-peek-postler-empathy-theme).\
\
Anyhow, this time it got my attention because it's
[favored](http://elementaryos.org/docs/apis/programming-languages)
programming language seems to be vala. Surprise :)\
\
A part of this effort is also to improve the programming experience by
providing an - in loose words - integrated development environment - an
editor (scratch + vala plugin) and build system (cmake). Nice.\
