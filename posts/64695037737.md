==================================

Thrilled! After a long time - and much much work by curros and
others[ICD support has landed for Mesa's
clover](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=6230f77232a4703c9f98f569104ac03430a5fb95)
OpenCL state tracker. This will allow us to install Mesa as an opencl
provider in parallel to others (which support OpenCL ICD) - like pocl.
