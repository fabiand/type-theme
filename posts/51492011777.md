OpenCL is a nice way to utilize vector processors or multi cores.\
But when it comes to writing and linking our software against a OpenCL
it doesn't seem to open anymore. Because currently you need to link to
one specific OpenCL implementatio, like AMD's or Intel's.\
Okay, that might in the normal case not be to problematic, but as Fedora
Packager I don't want to link some software to one specific
implementation, if there are several.\
This problem [already
appeared](http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2011-July/020796.html)
to the arch people and they just
[pulled](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPGPU) the - so called -
ICD loader out of one of the available implementations into the libCL
package, to solve this problem.\
\
**ICD loader**\
So how does this help? ICD is a
[mechanism](http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/extensions/khr/cl_khr_icd.txt)
specified by Khronos to allow several OpenCL implementations to be
installed side-by-side without disturbing each other. And the ICD loader
allows to freely choose between one of the available ones (if it
supports ICD), as the loader redirects the API calls to the choosen
implementation.\
\
**What we need** is some kind of just-an-ICD-loader which provides
/lib64/libOpenCL.so which is the in turn using the actual implementation
(e.g. pocl or the upcoming nouveau / clover \[hopefully AMD to\]
thing).\
\
There are already [some](http://www.zuzuf.net/FreeOCL/index.php)
[open](https://github.com/nbigaouette/oclutils/)
[ICD](http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=159051)
implementations available, maybe those can be reused.
