Sure. Unit-tests for code with heavy filesystem usage

Once upon a time ...

I've been reworking the network configuration part of [oVirt
Node](http://www.ovirt.org/Node). Node is now capable of creating bonds
and the use of bridge is now optionally.

*\<history optional="optional"\>*

Compared to the layout which was allowed before, these two changes allow
a broader range of network layouts.

We are still using soon-to-be-deprecated (?) ifcfg-files for network
configuration to configure the individual network devices.\
A bridge consisting of one slave - which is the tagged part of a bond -
this will result in at least five (5) ifcfg-files (depending how many
bond slaves you are using):

1.  Bridge
2.  Bond (master)
3.  Bond (slave)
4.  Tagged (part of the bond slave)
5.  Loopback

And that's were unit-tests come into play. I wanted to use unit-tests to
cover all possible configurations.

*\</history\>*

One goal was to really check the on-disk files, to cover the whole code
path. Without any mocking, the unit tests would involve filesystem
modifications, so creating and happily deleting files everywhere. That's
- obviously - not so nice.

This began rather cumbersome, I started
[mock-ing](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/) up the access to
individual files - and that is boring.

Another try involved using a chroot - but that made to many assumptions
about the runtime environment - IMO- and also required root privileges.

The current solution arose quite quick, faking filesystem access by
introducing a fake FS. For simplicity I also created a class for file
access - this class could then be mocked to redirect all file system
related calls to the fake filesystem.

\
Many words, here is [how it
looks](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5955820):

The solution works well with mock, and time will tell if it can also
cover our other usecases - and Node has a couple of places where we
interact with files :)

Finally I can only point you to our [unit-test which cover the network
setups](http://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node.git;a=blob;f=tests/nose/network_config.py;hb=HEAD).
