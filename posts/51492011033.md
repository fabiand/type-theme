Some of you may know [OpenCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) - the
open computing language. This language allows us to write kernels in a
C99 dialect, which can be run on data - in parallel.\
A common use case for such a language - and processing concept - is the
classical convolution - which was my motivation. Sure, this can also be
realized using the frequency domain, but - hey - I feel fine in the
spatial one.\
\
Anyhow, there are bindings for OpenCL - which is vendor (NVidia, AMD,
Intel, F/LOSS, ...) and hardware (GPU vs. CPU - AMD, Intel, IBM Cell,
...) independent for many languages, including MatLab, python, C, C++Â 
and so on ...\
In my case I needed a way to apply some filter function (or \[OpenCL\]
kernel) to a video stream from some FireWire camera.\
The experienced reader might directly associate FireWire with gstreamer
our multimedia framework of choice under linux.\
I had the option to Gather the data from a gstreamer pipeline reading
the FireWire camera or create a gstreamer element providing, as of
wrapping, the OpenCL functionality. The mentioned
[plugin](https://gitorious.org/valastuff/gst-plugins-cl) does the
latter, it provides a couple of elements to apply some OpenCL kernel to
the data of a gstreamer pipeline.\
\
You need vala and some gstreamer sources to build this project:\

    $ sudo yum install gstreamer-devel vala

.. might be a good start.\
You also need some OpenCL implementation, as of today pocl can be used,
but it's just intensively tested with the Nvidia implementation of it's
GPU SDK and with Intel OCL SDK.\
Building the plugin is quite simple\

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

\
Testing should also be quite easy:\

    $ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=src/.libs/
    $ gst-launch audiotestsrc ! clkernel ! autoaudiosink

This doesn't do much, as the default kernel just passes the data - but
at least you can test if the OpenCL is available. There are currently
three plugins:\

-   clkernel - An element to manipulate any buffer
-   clkernel2d - An element to manipulate a 2D buffer, like an gray
    image/video
-   clvideofilter - An element to manipulate an RGBA image/video

The OpenCL kernel can reside in an external file. You can pass the
filename of that file and the kernel to use to the element:\

    $ gst-launch audiotestsrc \
      ! clkernel kernel-file=mykernellib.cl kernel-name=somekernel \
      ! autoaudiosink

Have a look at the sources or kernel.cl and kernel2.cl files (they are
plaintext files, the kernel are build on the fly - heard of JIT?) in the
src directory to see what kind of signature the kernel has to provide.
(This should be documented more thoroughly).\
If you've got more than one platform which is OpenCL capable you can use
the platform-idx property to specify a specific platform.\
\
This plugins should help to offload some functionality to one or more
devices (like GPU, CPU and accelerator, like the CELL) and you don't
need to care about the details.\
This can now be used to do things like color conversion, all sorts of
filtering, mixing and what else can be done in parallel.\
Thos plugins are just a start, it would be nice to be able to provide
more sinks which then can be used as an input to the kernels.\
