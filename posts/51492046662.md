The
[previous](http://dummdida.blogspot.de/2013/03/a-package-for-rust-mozillas.html)
draft spec wasn't able to build rust with the official 0.6 sources. The
spec file is now updated and you can build your own rust package using:\

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/fabiand/rust-spec/master/rust.spec
    $ nice ionice rpmbuild --noclean -ba -v rust.spec

\
It is assumed that you've got a working fedora-package setup and an
internet connection.\
\
Changes are mainly that `chrpath` is used to remove rpaths from files.
Rust is still using it's own libuv and llvm.
