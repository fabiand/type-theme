4.0, automation, and upstream
=============================

oVirt 4.0 is out for a while. The Node team has been busy with
understanding a few - really, justa few - bugs around Node Next.

But at the bottom line we achieved what we aimed at: Lowering the
day-to-day load on our small team.

Using anaconda, cockpit, and LVM still looks promising.

Currently we are a little busy on working on implementing 4.1 features
(3rd party rpm persistence and miproved installation errors) as well as
improving the automation even more.

And beyond that? Well, I think documentation is the part that will
slowly see updates. We also need to improve our Jenkins CI. With one
step at a time we can move forwards.

And beyond that? Well, stabilization is the key here. Having a robust CI
helps to support this.

And beyond that? Well, upstream. Finally I think we can shift of fixing
stuff in upstream. In the previous years we were concerned about our
bugs in Node, and really had no room to fix them in upstream, because
there was none. Now, that we are really based on upstream again, we do
have the ability to contribute there.

So, after the hype on 4.0 we are slowly drifting into a day-to-day
maintenance again, but we don't drown in bugs, and that allows us to
improve and work upstream.
