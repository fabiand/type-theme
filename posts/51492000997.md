Have you ever wondered if there is a more convenient way to modify xml
documents, beside libxml2? Sure, there is the nice dom within Firefox,
but outside of that?\
Well, there is [augeas](http://augeas.net/). AFAIK
[initially](http://augeas.net/tour.html) a project to standardize the
interface to modify configuration files, in other words a common syntax
for different formats.\
Files are parsed trough so called
[lenses](http://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html). Those lenses
[transform](http://augeas.net/docs/builtins.html) the actual file (e.g.
*httpd.conf* or *passwd*) into a
[tree](http://augeas.net/docs/tree.html), which than can be modified by
a set of augeas commands.\
As lenses are bi-directional the same lense can be used to read a file,
and to dump the [(internal augeas)
tree](http://augeas.net/docs/tree.html) back into a valid configuration
file. A nice concept, ey?\
\
A back to the topic, one of the lenses - Xml.lns - can be used to modify
XML files.\
The following example creates a dummy xml file and modifies it using
augtool.\
\
\

    $ sudo yum install augeas tidyp

    $ cat > abc.xml 
    Hi there.

    EOF

    $ augtool -LA -e # Load XML lense
    set /augeas/load/xml/lens "Xml.lns"
    set /augeas/load/xml/incl "$PWD/abc.xml"
    load

    # Dump internal tree
    print /files

    # Add a note
    set /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/note/#attribute/timestamp "now"
    set /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/note/#text "Wtf"

    # Change the text of a node.
    set /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/child/#text "Hello World."

    # Insert a new child after the present child
    ins child after /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/child
    set /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/child[2]/#text "Hello Mars."

    # Insert a new child - anywhere ..
    set /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/child[3]/#text "Hello Jupiter Jones."

    # More children
    set /files/$PWD/abc.xml/world/child[4]/child/child/#text "Hello Mars."

    print /files/$PWD/abc.xml

    save
    print /augeas//error
    EOF

    $ tidyp -xml -i -q 
    $ unlink abc.xml

\
With the help from the people at \#augeas on freenode, I found out that
(a) there is a small bug preventing the usage of relative paths and (b)
You need a little knowledge about the format you are writin to. In the
(xml) example above, you need to specify attributes before specifying a
\#text node, because they are written first. If they were specified the
other way round, augeas would fail while saving.
